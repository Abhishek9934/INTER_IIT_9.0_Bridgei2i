article_4002,"Overview:

Be it as a means for food or as pets, animals have an age-old relationship with human beings. That is why the well-being of these animals become all the more necessary. Hence, veterinary vaccines are gaining traction across the Middle East & Africa (MEA). Veterinary vaccines ensure improved health and increased production of the livestock and reduce cost substantially. At the same time, it prohibits the transmission of diseases to other animals or human beings. Climate is playing a crucial role in triggering growth in number of the cases registered with animals getting affected by diseases. The second factor constantly influencing the market is the increase in spending on companion animals. This makes the owners seek assistance to apply veterinary vaccines to their animals to ensure their healthy life as well as of people around the animal. The region has a huge number of unvaccinated livestock which is becoming a concern as the dairy and meat sectors are also burgeoning. Hygiene has always been a problem with this region, and this can result in animals getting affected by diseases. And factors can have a knock-down effect on the MEA veterinary vaccines market and aid it to inflate with CAGR 7.1% during the forecast period (2013-2022) to reach USD 550.84 million, asserts Market Research Future (MRFR) in a detailed study.

However, research and development in this sector can incur high investment which considering the end price of products may not seem beneficial.

article_4004,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday to convey his strong condemnation of the terror attack near the Israeli Embassy here on January 29 and asserted that India will deploy all its resources to find and punish the perpetrators.

In his conversation with Netanyahu over phone, Modi assured him that India accords the highest importance to the safety and security of Israeli diplomats and premises, a PMO statement.

“Both leaders expressed satisfaction about the close coordination between Indian and Israeli security agencies in this context,” it added.

The two leaders also briefed each other about the progress in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in their countries, and discussed possibilities of further collaboration in this area.

A low-intensity blast had occurred outside the embassy on January 29. No one was injured.

Some cars were damaged in the blast that occurred about 150 metres away from the embassy on Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road in the very high-security Lutyens’ bungalow zone.

The Israeli foreign ministry said all its diplomats and embassy staff in Delhi are “safe and sound”.

article_4005,"New Delhi, Feb 1 (PTI) The Delhi High Court Monday sought to know whether US-based e-commerce giant Amazon and Kishore Biyani led Future Retail Ltd (FRL) were open to resolving the issue arising out of Rs 24,713 crore deal between FRL and Reliance Retail.

The counsel for both, Amazon and Future Group, submitted that they would seek instructions and inform the court on Tuesday.

The court was hearing a plea by Amazon seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by Singapore's Emergency Arbitrator (EA) restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail.

Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, in its plea, also sought detention of the Biyanis, directors of Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) and FRL and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged 'wilful disobedience' of the emergency arbitrator's order.

Justice J R Midha asked the parties to inform it on Tuesday if any such endeavour could be made and clarified that this should not be taken as deferring the proceedings and it would continue as scheduled. The court, which asked if any attempt has been made to resolve the issue, suggested that if parties would be willing, it can refer the matter to two retired judges of the Supreme Court.

The court also said it will consider whatever protective order can be passed.

In commercial matters, it is always helpful to find a solution,” it said.

To this, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, representing Amazon, said he will take instructions on it as nothing tangible has happened.

Senior advocate Darius Khambata, representing FRL, also said he will take instructions and inform the court.

Amazon has approached the high court seeking to restrain Kishore Biyani-led Future Group from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (MDA) Group.

It also sought to restrain Future Group from taking any steps to transfer or dispose of FRL's retail assets or the shares held in FRL by the Biyanis in any manner without prior written consent of Amazon.

Story continues

The Future Group and Amazon have been locked in a battle after the US-based company took FRL into the emergency arbitration over alleged breach of a contract between them.

The three domestic firms -- FRL, FCPL and Reliance -- have however contended before the high court that if Amazon's claim -- that it indirectly invested in FRL by investing in FCL -- was accepted then it would amount to a violation of Indian foreign direct investment laws which permit only 10 per cent investment by a foreign entity in the multi-brand retail sector.

According to Amazon, the EA award passed under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules is enforceable under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.

It referred to an order passed by the high court on December 21, 2020, prima facie holding that the EA's award was valid under the Indian law.

Senior advocate Harish Salve, also representing FRL, had earlier submitted that Amazon had a deal with FCPL and signed an agreement with Biyani. FCPL has a shareholding agreement with FRL which has no agreement with Amazon.

Subramanium had urged that FRL shall not further precipitate the situation as the matter is being heard by the court.

In the petition, Amazon has alleged that Future Group, Kishore Biyani and other promoters and directors have “deliberately and maliciously disobeyed” the EA award despite it being binding on them and not having challenged it in accordance with the law.

“The majority respondents' action of simply ignoring the order (of EA) and continuing with the impugned transaction (deal) is not only contumacious but calls into serious question their respect for enforceability of contracts, the rule of law and the administration of justice..,” it said.

It sought to injunct Future Group and its officials from taking any steps in furtherance of the deal with Reliance.

In August last year, Future had reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance.

The SIAC on October 25 last year, had passed an interim order in favour of Amazon barring FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.

Subsequently, Amazon wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and Competition Commission of India (CCI), urging them to take into consideration the Singapore arbitrator's interim decision as it is a binding order, FRL had earlier told the high court.

As per the SIAC interim order, a three-member arbitration panel needs to be set up within 90 days (from the date of the judgement) with one judge each being appointed by Future and Amazon, along with a third neutral judge.

On November 10, 2020, Amazon had told the court that it and FCL have appointed their respective arbitrators. PTI SKV RKS RKS"

Housing for all and affordable housing were termed priority areas in Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's budget. The Union Budget proposed extension of interest deduction for home buyers and tax holidays on affordable housing projects for one more year.

""In the July 2019 Budget, I provided an additional deduction of interest, amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh, for loan taken to purchase an affordable house. I propose to extend the eligibility of this deduction by one more year, to 31st March 2022,"" Sitharaman said in her budget speech.

Jaxay Shah, Chairman, CREDAI National, said this move will boost overall demand for affordable housing, which has been the fastest growing segment for the real estate sector. Anuj Puri, Chairman - ANAROCK Property Consultants, said these steps will keep demand buoyant for affordable housing in 2021 as well. Further, the extension of the tax holiday for affordable housing projects for one more year will help bring in more new supply within this segment.

As per ANAROCK Research, affordable housing already accounts for more than 35 per cent of the supply across the top seven cities in the country.

The budget also proposed amendments to allow debt funding through estate investment trusts (REITs) and infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs).

Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO - India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE said, ""Proposing to make dividend payments to REIT (estate investment trusts) and Infrastructure investment trusts exempt from TDS this year is another great move as it will be helpful in addressing the liquidity situation in the real estate industry. Debt Financing of InVITs and REITs by Foreign Portfolio Investors has been enabled by suggesting amendments in the relevant legislations. This is likely to ease access of finance to InVITS and REITs thus augmenting funds for the infrastructure and real estate sector.""

However, the industry at large felt ignored as most of its demands did not find a mention in Sitharaman's budget.

Surendra Hiranandani, Chairman and Managing Director, House of Hiranandani, said the government could have given a further boost to the real estate sector. ""There have been many pressing concerns in the real sector that have not been addressed such as easing liquidity, reduction in levies/taxes, tax deductions on home loans to give impetus to buyer sentiment, granting of industry status to the overall real estate sector and implementation of single window clearance amongst others,"" said Hiranandani.

Shah of Credai also said that popular demands for changes in IT slabs, increasing the limit of 80C, lower home loan interest rates etc were not announced in the budget. Steps required to ensure more money in the hands of taxpayers to encourage spending were also not addressed.

Lindsay Bernard Rodrigues, Co-Founder and Director, Bennet & Bernard Group, said the sector needed many more interventions on the demand side for meaningful growth. He added, ""The Indian real estate sector is the most highly taxed with the combination of high direct and indirect taxes, stamp duties and levies for development approvals which have been crippling growth. A key expectation was the restoration of income tax benefit on a second home which would have benefitted home buyers in a big way and stimulated the real estate sector. It was also important to bring back the input tax credit as part of GST reforms and lower GST rates for purchase of raw materials which would have helped reduce the cost of construction."""

Earlier this month, the UK financial regulator also said bitcoin investors could well ""lose all their money."" Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are ""high-risk, speculative investments,"" and should be treated as such, the regulator said at the time.""If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money,"" the Financial Conduct Authority said in a January 11 statement

That sentiment was shared on Friday by Makhlouf, who has also been governor of the Central Bank of Ireland since 2019.

ECB members have often urged investors to use caution when buying and holding cryptocurrency. In 2018, for example, Yves Mersch, a member of the executive board, said bitcoin was ""far inferior to existing payment options.""

As bitcoin surged to new all-time highs in mid-January, ECB President Christine Lagarde called for additional regulation on such assets. She said bitcoin is not a currency , but is instead a ""highly speculative asset which has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity.""

The following day, bitcoin rallied above $40,000 for the first time.

It's since fallen to by more than 7%, trading at about $32,770 on Sunday afternoon. Some analysts have said the cryptocurrency could be the next ""great tech stock,"" growing over the next decade the way Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google grew in the last few years.

On Friday, Makhlouf urged fellow central bank administrators to keep a close eye on cryptocurrency, especially ""in their regulatory role.""

article_4009,"Diabetes during pregnancy linked to heart disease risk

New York, Feb 1 : Expecting mothers, take note. A new study indicates that diabetes during pregnancy may increase the risk of heart disease.



The study suggests that women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) are twice as likely by mid-life to develop calcium in heart arteries -- a strong predictor of heart disease -- even if healthy blood sugar levels were attained many years after pregnancy.



""We were surprised to discover that women with a history of gestational diabetes are at a significantly greater risk of heart artery calcification, even if they maintain normal blood sugar levels after pregnancy,"" said co-author Erica P.



Gunderson from Kaiser Permanente in California, US.



For the study, published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association, the team enrolled approximately 1,100 women without Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who subsequently gave birth at least once during the 25-year study period, which ended in 2011.







Blood tests were performed from before to after pregnancies at five-year intervals to determine if women had normal blood sugar levels, intermediate elevations in blood sugar levels (pre-diabetes) or they had developed overt Type 2 diabetes.







Heart scans were performed to measure coronary artery calcium, a strong predictor for heart disease, at exams 15, 20 and 25 years after the baseline, the first exam of the study.



At the 25-year follow-up, the participants' median age was 48 years, and 12 per cent of the women in the study had a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes.







The prospective analysis found that women with a history of gestational diabetes had a two-fold higher risk of coronary artery calcification whether they had healthy blood sugar levels, pre-diabetes or Type 2 diabetes.



Of women with previous gestational diabetes, 36 per cent developed pre-diabetes and 26 per cent developed Type 2 diabetes, compared to 35 per cent and 9 per cent of women with no history of gestational diabetes, the researchers said.

Kangana joined in, too, and posted: ""That's true Hansal sir, even you will agree with that, I stood by you and now you saying this, feel like singing 'achcha sila diya tune mere payaar ka'.""



To which, Hansal replied: ""Firstly, the tweet wasn't about you.



Secondly, there are things that happened after the film that left me more than hurt. It made me sorely regret making the film. All said and done you remain a fine, fine actor. And you have my respect for that. And for your kindness.""



On Monday, Apurva took note of the conversation, and wrote: ""I guess the writer was the kabab mein haddi in this glorious love story.



Mistake toh mujhe admit karna chahiye (I guess I should be the one accepting the mistake). #Simran.""



The film is about a divorcee named Praful Patel who loses her savings in a gambling bout.



She then takes a loan to set things straight, and when she is unable to repay it, she finds herself drawn into a life of crime.



""Simran"", said to be based on a true story, faced controversy around its release when screenwriter Apurva Asrani alleged that Kangana, who has been credited as additional dialogue and story writer of the project, tried to discredit him by claiming she had developed the story with Mehta from a one-line script.



The film turned out to be a dud at the box office.

article_4011,"Twitter suspended several accounts of high-profile celebrities and organisations on Monday. The accounts of actor Sushant Singh, Caravan magazine, Kisan Ekta Morcha, Tractor2twitr and several other politicians, farmer leaders, writers and activists, were suspended at the behest of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for spreading misinformation during the farmers' protests.



The IT ministry and law enforcement agencies had last week ordered Twitter to block these tweets and accounts under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act.



A Twitter spokesperson said that many countries have laws that may apply to Tweets and/or Twitter account content.



""In our continuing effort to make our services available to people everywhere, if we receive a properly scoped request from an authorised entity, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time,"" the micro-blogging platform said in a statement.



Transparency is vital to protecting freedom of expression, so we have a notice policy for withheld content. Upon receipt of requests to withhold content, we will promptly notify the affected account holders (unless we are prohibited from doing so e.g. if we receive a court order under seal),"" the company informed.



Twitter last week said it suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation as the farmers' tractor rally went violent in the national capital on the 72nd Republic Day.



The farmers swarmed the Red Fort and waved farmer union flags from its ramparts. They even hoisted farmer union flags as well as a pennant with a Sikh religious symbol from a flagpole.



A Twitter spokesperson told IANS that the company has taken strong enforcement action to protect the conversation on the service from attempts to incite violence, abuse and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm by blocking certain terms that violate our rules for trends.



""Using a combination of technology and human review, Twitter worked at scale and took action on hundreds of Tweets that have been in violation of the Twitter Rules and suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation,"" the spokesperson informed.



The Delhi Police had warned that 308 Twitter handles have been generated to create confusion over the tractor rally proposed by protesting farmers on Republic Day.

article_4012,"Finance Minister Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman has presented Union Budget for FY 2021-22 to push the growth of the nation. There are few key announcements in the budget that will support growth for major industries who all are struggling due to challenges from the ongoing pandemic. FM's announcement to boost 6 major areas during the budget will support for our economy to recover in the year 2021. ICT industry plays a very important role in the growth of the economy for our country, and now when the budget is presented to the people of India, there are reactions from the industry leaders. The tech leaders have shared their views with Digital Terminal. Read below the opinion:

“The 35% Increase in Capital Spending On Infrastructure, Spells The Biggest Budget Highlight”



Rajesh Gupta, Country Manager & Director – India Sales, Micron

“The 35% increase in capital spending on infrastructure, spells the biggest budget highlight. I see this investment of catalyzing a virtuous of investment, growth and jobs. The proposed amendments to the Companies Act of 2013, will pave the way for entrepreneurs to set up operations in India and that from a technology and innovation standpoint is critical as we navigate and win in the fourth industrial revolution.”

“We Believe That The Union Budget 2021 Announcement Has Covered Several Important Issues”

Alok Dubey, Chief Finance Officer, Acer India

“At Acer, we believe that the Union Budget 2021 announcement has covered several important issues faced by the economy and is going to bring growth opportunities despite the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several areas where the honourable Finance Minister has announced allocations of funds. This year the government aims to spend Rs 1.97 lakh crore on various PLI schemes over the next 5 years, starting this fiscal. This is in addition to the Rs 40,951 crore announced for the PLI for electronic manufacturing schemes which will accelerate growth opportunities for the industry. And, we look forward to a complete policy and leveraging the same to kickstart domestic manufacturing.""

“Extensive Research And Development, And Major Infrastructure Developments Are Definitely The Need Of The Hour”

Dipesh Kaura, General Manager, Kaspersky (South Asia)

""The budget for FY 2021- 22 was one with the aim to achieve and enhance our country's top priorities, by investing in the healthcare sector and major infrastructures. Enhanced healthcare systems, extensive research and development, and major infrastructure developments are definitely the need of the hour and have been effectively taken care of by the budget allocation set by our FM. The goal to empower 15000 schools and adapt to a hybrid education model is also a very promising step taken towards the digital transformation of the country. However, to make this a success, securing the hybrid education system is equally important, especially in the near future. While pursuing a hybrid model of learning (in-person and remote), the educational sector continues to attract the attention of cybercriminals on the Internet. From July to December 2020, 270,171 users globally encountered various threats disguised as popular learning platforms—an increase of 60% when compared to the first half of 2020. These numbers state the growing need for cybersecurity and why it is important to build a robust and secure digital infrastructure for the education sector.

“Similarly, cybersecurity tools will also be needed for the seamless functioning of advanced technologies like deep analytics and artificial intelligence that the government plans to use to identify tax evaders, fake billers and for the digital census. The newer technologies can be used considerably for sectors like BFSI, healthcare, education, and can help in extensive R&D, provided that they are used with utmost security so as to avoid their misuse by cybercriminals who are capable of creating more chaos than one can expect. It will be interesting to see India's education and other sectors further progressing towards digitalisation in the next 1-2 years, and cybersecurity experts and companies like us will be glad to help the country secure this digital future at every step taken forward.""

“Focus On Innovation And R&D Lays Down Strong Foundation In Building A Self-Reliant Digital India”

Supria Dhanda, Vice President and Country Manager for India, Western Digital

“I would like to congratulate the Government on its first paperless budget to push India in its digital journey. The economic survey highlighted India’s aspiration to compete on Innovation with the top ten economies. Allocation of INR 50,000 crore for the National Research Fund for next five years is a definite step towards boosting the research ecosystem in a coordinated way. Focus on Innovation and R&D, coupled with the PLI for electronic manufacturing schemes lays down a very strong foundation in building a self-reliant digital India. We are confident that the technology industry will join hands with the Government in its plan to enhance manufacturing capabilities and expand R&D centres.”

""We Are Happy to See the Government’s Focus On The Adoption Of Technology In The Budget 2021”

Kuldeep Malhotra: Director & Vice President Sales, Konica Minolta Business Solutions India Pvt Ltd.

""We are happy to see the government’s focus on the adoption of technology in the budget 2021. Advancements like data analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning is a great step towards the technological development of the country. The extension of the tax holiday by one year is equally a welcome step that will give businesses more time to recuperate from the losses caused by COVID-19 and help them steer back to the pre-pandemic days. The motive of the Government's Minimum Government, Maximum Governance will provide a hold of trust to the society. The steps taken are providing ease of business for the organizations.""

“The Government’s Allocation of Rs. 3,000 Crore Towards Skill Development is A Step in The Right Direction”



Sunil Sharma, Managing Director – Sales, Sophos India & SAARC

""The Government’s Union Budget 2021 is built on the foundation of new technologies such as Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) which will empower businesses with econsultation, escrutiny, and compliance management. This is surely going to enhance enterprise cybersecurity as AI has immense potential to bring in scalable and effective defenses against sophisticated attacks like ransomware. That said, this increased penetration of digital technologies brings with it additional cyber risks that one should be vary of. As per our recent survey, with 100% Indian businesses being concerned about their current level of cloud security, there is a need for initiatives that promote the development of cybersecurity skillsets. Additionally, this reskilling process should also take care of security of cloud environments which are the backbone of the accelerated digital transformation that India is witnessing due to the pandemic. While we welcome the Government's proposed steps in strengthening MSMEs that provide employment to millions of people, we need more impetus on building skilled cybersecurity professionals in the country. The Government’s allocation of Rs. 3,000 crore towards skill development that will help reskill India’s youth and boost the overall economy, is a step in the right direction.”

“The Emphasis on Education, Power And Infrastructure Sector Will Support The Overall Development Of The Nation”

Gurpreet Singh, Managing Director, Arrow PC Network Pvt Ltd (Titanium Partner - Dell Technologies)

""Regressive rules had certainly affected the ease of doing business for many organizations and start-ups. However, the government's announcement of establishing a separate administrative structure especially for ease of doing business will help many organizations benefit in the future. Revision of the definition of small companies by raising the capital base to Rs 2 Cr from the current limit of Rs 50 lakh will give a big boost to companies affecting their monetary status. Though not much of changes have been made in terms of income tax slabs, the move to make changes in tax evasion has instilled confidence in common man that they would not be facing tax harassment. Earmarking Rs 1,500Cr for promoting digital mode of payment and changing the tax audit limit from Rs 5Cr to Rs 10Cr will benefit many and will allow transparency. Hiking of FDI from 49% to 74% is a good move. The announcement that the forthcoming census would be digital shows the government's initiative to practice what is being preached. On the other end, the emphasis on education, power and infrastructure sector will support the overall development of the nation.""

“Union Budget 2021 Has Brought Many Hopes For IT Sector”

Alok Verma, Marketing Head, Tenda

“Union Budget 2021 has brought many hopes for IT sector. The big boom for the sector is the budget proposals of Digital Census 2021 and revamping of Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA 21 3.0) portal. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government will use data analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning to launch MCA 21 3.0 which will add the facility of e-scrutiny, e-consultation, compliance management, and e-adjudication among others. The First Digital Census 2021 will be the first of its kind in the country. This will increase a boost in business for both hardware companies, which will likely see a surge in sales of laptops, tablets, smartphones, networking devices and printers, as well as software companies that will run and build the technology-enabled backend.”

“Government Intends To Boost Local Manufacturing Through Its Announcements In Various PLI Scheme”

Avneet Singh Marwah, Director and CEO, Super Plastronics Pvt. Ltd, a Kodak brand Licensee

“Government intends to boost local manufacturing through its announcements in various PLI scheme in next five years. As part of consumer electronics, televisions should be considered to be included into the scheme. Also a dedicated Freight Corridor will be a game changer for supply chain of manufacturing. By spending on infrastructure, India will be competitive at global stage. Like metals, Govt should consider taking back customs duty on panels as there is increase of prices by 300% on the raw materials.”

“The Six Pillars of The Union Budget 2021 Add Enormous Value To The Economic Relief”



Rahul Agarwal, CEO & Managing Director, Lenovo India

“The six pillars of the Union Budget 2021 add enormous value to the economic relief post the pandemic issues and paint a futuristic picture for the new year. It has managed to address some of the key issues around Atmanirbhar Bharat, education and Digital India that presents significant business opportunities for global corporates such as Lenovo. With the PLI scheme announced along with the increased focus on ‘Make in India’ in this budget, we are confident that it will encourage local manufacturing, and further bolster the local PC market. Lenovo will also support the government in enriching India’s economy, by boosting digital infrastructure in the field of education and additional focus on promoting inclusive development. The national education policy also creates an opportunity to build the Indian EdTech ecosystem to make it best across the globe for research & innovation, and empowers the citizens to scale up their skills.”

“We Do Welcome The Recent PLI Scheme Of The Government”

Mike Chen, General Manager, TCL India

“We do welcome the recent PLI scheme of the government. However, we need to ease up the duty imposed on raw materials keeping in mind the make in India thought. We should also be getting added incentives so that transformative measures can be taken. The industry contributes 25% of the country's GDP.”

“The Budget of 2021 Is Well Designed To Give A Boost To The Local Manufacturing”

Arjun Bajaaj, Director, Videotex International Group

“The budget of 2021 is well designed to give a boost to the local manufacturing and improve the infrastructure of the country. More details will be made available and cleared in days to come for the exact benefits to the manufacturing sector. However, no particular exemption of duty reduction of OC and GST reduction on greater than 32” sizes of TV was announced which was expected this year to boost sales.""

“The Budget Is A Major Step In The Right Direction”

Rajiv Bhalla, MD, Barco India

“The budget is a major step in the right direction. It outlays a strong focus on infrastructure, healthcare, capital spending, disinvestment, monetization, job creation and digitization. These measures are not only progressive and recovery-led, if implemented correctly would ease the burden on the economy and lead India towards the projected v-shaped growth and development. The budget talks about structural reforms in banking, enhancing debt financing and credit limits for businesses and asset monetization. This will lead to an increase in government spending, which, in turn will spur demand, therefore net positive for the industry. The several initiatives around job-creation, startups, reskilling, rural development and better quality of services to people are positive as a Nation cannot progress without care for the environment and inclusive all-round transformation.”

“The Union Budget 2021-2022 Has A Pragmatic Approach To Revive The COVID-19 Hit Economy”

Ameen Khwaja, Founder and CEO, pTron

“The Union Budget 2021-2022 has a pragmatic approach to revive the COVID-19 hit economy. While the budget stressed on Atmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India, it is important to note that the costs would only increase in the immediate future for the existing players in Consumer Electronics Industry. An increase in import duties is a welcome move towards Atmanirbhar. However, considering that the current availability of technical skill and machinery isn't strong, the industry is likely to witness a struggle in the short-run due to an increase in cost for importing components and parts leading to an increase in the manufacturing cost for the players in the market.”

“Overall It Is A Very Pleasant Budget Without Any Surprises”

Rajesh Goenka, Director, Sales & Marketing, RP tech India

“Overall it is a very pleasant budget without any surprises which is good because in the current scenario consistency and continuity is more important rather than having mere aspirations. This is overall a balanced budget and only enhances the momentum set by our prime minister and finance minister in the last two years. In terms of IT hardware industry, there is no major change, however, with the government investment, the overall market demand is likely to grow up. IMF has also forecasted the industry growth 11 to 11.5 per cent, which is good for the industry. So overall we are optimistic about the budget”

“The Move to Provide Greater Impetus to India’s Manufacturing Sector is Indeed A Welcome Move”

Dr. Keshab Panda, CEO & MD, L&T Technology Services

“The move to provide greater impetus to India’s manufacturing sector with outlay of almost Rs 2 trillion over the next five years is indeed a welcome move. We are hopeful, this will pave the way for enhanced adoption of digital engineering capabilities by domestic players, especially in the Industry 4.0 segment, to give them a global edge. With patents and innovations being at the core of our proposition as a pure-play engineering services provider, it was encouraging to know that Innovation and R&D was classified under the six pillars of focus for this year’s union budget. Unlike last year where explicit mention to initiatives such as National Mission on Quantum Computing and Technology were announced, one would have hoped that this year’s budget would have made provision for further focus.”

“The Union Budget Is Overall Balanced And There Has Been Major Push To Infrastructure Sector”

Vipul Bhandari, Executive Director, Supertron Electronics

“The Union Budget is overall balanced and there has been major push to infrastructure sector. These push will increase government spending and money will flow to various section of the society and this will ultimately result in buoyancy in the market and the IT industry also get some positive gain down the line in a time horizon of 6 to 12 months.”

“At UBON, We Believe That The Budget 2021 Is An Encouraging One”

Mandeep Arora, Managing Director, UBON

“At UBON, we believe that the Budget 2021 is an encouraging one. Proposing the scheme to encourage domestic electronic manufacturing mobile phones, semiconductor packaging and electronic equipment is a welcoming move and we look forward to a complete policy to leverage it in expanding manufacturing in our new factories. Furthermore, painting a futuristic picture in this year’s budget, madam finance minister acknowledged the role of advanced technologies like IoT, AI, and analytics in shaping the world. We are forever committed to advancing our ‘AI x IoT’ ecosystem in India and will continue to invest in cutting-edge technologies to offer the best services to our customers in India. Another aspect which I want to applaud in this year’s budget is withdrawing exemptions on parts of chargers and sub-parts of mobiles. From a consumer electronics industry perspective, the decision is a welcome move and boosts the industry sentiments. This will further give a boost to Indian Manufacturing industry and propel more investors in the sector.”

“The Union Budget 2021 Has Given A Hope To The Consumer Durables Industry”

Lalit Arora, Co-founder and CEO, VingaJoy (a unit of Ubon)

“The Union Budget 2021 has given a hope to the consumer durables industry as it provided incentives for local manufacturers, reduction in taxes on eco-friendly and energy-efficient products along with waiver of customs duty on imported inputs to make components. It is likely to attract global players in the Indian manufacturing sector as the Government is planning to offer plug-and-play infrastructure to the companies willing to come to India. Domestic electronic manufacturing has grown rapidly. We are now exporting items like mobiles and chargers. For greater domestic value addition, we are withdrawing a few exemptions on parts of chargers and sub- parts of mobiles. Further, some parts of mobiles will move from ‘nil’ rate to a moderate 2.5%.”

“Budget 2021 Promises to Provide The Much-Needed Economic Velocity to India’s Growth Cycle”



CP Gurnani, MD & CEO, Tech Mahindra

“This budget is a step in the direction towards Atmanirbharta, clearly providing every opportunity that is required for a sustainable economic momentum and growth. The FM has provided for ample opportunity to boost and sustain the gig economy, digital payments and research and development taking place within the country. The focus on innovation and R&D (Research & Development) as an important pillar is a critical step in increasing the export income of Indian IT sector. Along with this, the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ budget also outlines initiatives for gig economy, digital payments, human capital while also setting up fintech hub and National Natural Language Translation Missions. Therefore, with increased allocation towards infrastructure, financial inclusion and healthcare, Budget 2021 promises to provide the much-needed economic velocity to India’s growth cycle.”

“Providing Financial And Tax Audit Incentives to Promote Digital Transactions is A Progressive Step”

Rajesh Nambiar, Chairman and Managing Director for India, Cognizant

“Coming as it does during an unprecedented global crisis, the Union Budget for 2021 is justifiably focused on resetting the Indian economy and enabling it to emerge from the shadows of a prolonged and unforeseen disruption. The accent on improving healthcare, manufacturing and infrastructure as part of India’s mission to drive greater self-reliance will not only create more employment opportunities, but also accelerate the country’s shift towards digital modernisation and transformation that have become a key competitive differentiator in the new normal for businesses and governments alike. Measures such as establishing a world-class fintech hub, and further incentivising start-ups will provide impetus to innovation, entrepreneurship and R&D in the country. Providing financial and tax audit incentives to promote digital transactions is a progressive step that will result in greater transparency and reduced compliance burden.”

“Consistent with India’s towering role in today’s knowledge economy, initiatives such as broadening foreign academic collaborations, leveraging synergies between various research institutions, universities, and colleges across India, amending the Apprenticeship Act to provide enhanced post-education apprenticeship and training opportunities to graduates, and moving towards implementing a Higher Education Commission of India will help enhance the quality of education as well as the vocational and industry skills available in the country. The proposed National Digital Educational Architecture is a welcome move to encourage a digital-first mind-set across the country’s education ecosystem for it to reinvent itself and rise to the learning and employability needs of the digital era.”

“Leaving the tax rates alone signals a stable tax environment. Reducing the time limit for re-opening of assessment to three years, setting up a faceless income tax appellate tribunal, and strengthening the NCLT with e-Courts and a conciliation mechanism for contractual disputes will increase corporate and investor confidence by paving the way to greater transparency and expeditious action. There isn’t much in the budget for the IT industry, a sector that has done outstanding work to keep essential services rolling in various parts of the world through immensely difficult circumstances. We were hoping for an announcement related to the easing of SEZ rules for the IT industry.”

“A Very Significant Budget As India Is Coming Out Fast From Effects Of COVID-19”

Rajeev Singh, Managing Director, BenQ India

“A very significant budget as India is coming out fast from effects of COVID 19, Government has given strong emphasis on spending on Infrastructure along with big push for Atmanirbhar Bharat. Alongside, there is no change in direct taxes largely which were moderated for companies last time. This will mean more money in the system and will act positively towards faster growth of economy. Government has also given additional push to education and skill development segment in the budget which will result in extensive use of technology which in turn will give a boost to virtual classroom and Blended and Hybrid Learning.”

“The Union Budget 2021 Has A Strong Focus Towards The Revival Of The Economy”

Sameer Katole, CEO, Crossloop

“The Hon’ble Finance Minister laid major emphasis on enhancing domestic manufacturing of electronic equipment. The Union Budget 2021 has a strong focus towards the revival of the economy and extensive plans for Atmanirbhar Bharat. It shows extreme commitment towards a strong comeback for the sectors which faced major backlashes in 2020. The budget covered several demanding issues faced by the economy earlier and with an attention concerning startup community, the extension of tax holiday for start-ups by one more year is an important decision made. This will encourage the survival of startups and give them the required support for bounce back. Further, the increased spending on PLI for electronic manufacturing schemes is a positive sign. The 2.5% taxation on manufacturing of smartphone parts is also a vital decision as it will boost the inclusive growth of the country and further bring major changes in the consumer electronic and domestic manufacturing segment.”

“Hopefully, From Here We Will See Further Reduction in Compliance Burden For Startups”

Yashash Agarwal, CEO, Gamezop

“The proposed broadening of the definition of Small Companies to include those up to Rs. 2 Cr. in paid up capital (as opposed to current limit of Rs. 50 lakh) as well those who have turnover of up to Rs. 20 Cr. (as opposed to Rs. 2 Cr. currently) is meaningful. Companies that qualify as Small Companies are subject to lesser number of compliances in conduct of board meeting, internal financial control reporting, annual return and financial statements, and so on. Hopefully, from here we will see further reduction in compliance burden for startups.”

“The Government Could Have Put More Money In The Hands Of People”

S Sriram, Chief Strategy Officer, iValue InfoSolutions

“Budget 2021 was positive given the challenge around higher fiscal deficit due to lower income. It is great to see emphasis on growth front keeping fiscal deficit priority low for the next 2-3 years. The key highlights of the budget include additional allocation to health and wellbeing in a Covid ravaged year with Rs 35,000Cr allocation to Covid vaccination with 4 Indian vaccines shortly. It is also great to see 35% enhancement of Government capital expenditure at Rs 5.54 lac Cr to revive economy around Road, Rail and Metro infrastructure. It is encouraging to see focus around disinvestment with 2 PSU banks and 1 Insurance company being planned for the year with Rs 1.75 lac Cr target. FDI in insurance enhancement from 49% to 74% augers well for a country with very low penetration. The voluntary vehicle scrapping policy is set to help auto sector and address the pollution challenges. While Rs 20,000Cr PSU bank recapitalisation looks on the lower side, reopening of IT assessment cases period reduction from 6 to 3 years should give comfort to tax payers on documentation. Planned LIC IPO should set the mood right on disinvestment. The government could have put more money in the hands of people to sustain the recovery along with sops to Business on CapEx investments.”

“Emphasis on Digital Payment is Very Good “

Prashanth GJ, CEO, TechnoBind

Increased spend on Healthcare and Infra are welcome moves - as this will have a cascading effect on the economy in the medium term. Whether it is Highways or Railways the enhanced allocation is very encouraging. Also interesting is the 'Bad Bank' which will help address the stressed assets through an ARC model. This will help keep the Banking system insulated from the spike of bad loans that are expected now - thereby allowing them to do business as usual by giving the much-needed support of credit in the system. The MSME allocation has been doubled - this too will help SME businesses in general which is a big market for us in the country. Support for furthering the idea of Digital India is also seen and it is very welcome - encouraging digital payments and the use of AI/ML in governance is exciting. Emphasis on Digital Payment is very good as this will go a long way in bringing in financial inclusion. Provisions in the GST and customs duty rationalization is something we look forward to.

“The Stress Made In Green Energy Projects Has Made This Budget Wholesome”

Shibu Paul, Vice President - International Sales, Array Networks

""The fiscal deficit for 2020-21 was estimated at 9.5% of GDP, the government's aim is to bring it down by 5% of the GDP by 2025-26 which is ambitious and certainly a welcoming initiative. The highlight in this budget is the announcement of the Asset Reconstruction Company and Asset Management Company to help banks tackle bad loans which have been a call by economists for many years. The significance given to the investments and initiatives in the infrastructure development with a few coming under the PPP model will boost the overall development which includes increased investment opportunity from various sectors. The government's proposal to use data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning-driven for the Ministry of Corporate Affairs' database is a boost to the digitalization where the Version 3.0 of MCA-21 includes additional modules for e-scrutiny, e-adjudication, e-consultation and compliance management. Connecting more than 1,000 mandis into E-NAM is an excellent move. Setting up a separate administration structure for ease of doing business would help many organizations from various sectors. The faceless dispute resolution panel would help the citizens by keeping them safe from tax harassment. The importance given to healthcare sector to fight Covid and any future healthcare issues, the stress made in green energy projects like keeping aside Rs 1,000Cr for solar energy and Rs 1,500Cr for renewable energy along with voluntary scrapping policy and the weightage given to education has made this budget wholesome."""

New Delhi [India], February 1 (ANI/NewsVoir): After starting the year on a high note, Sonalika Tractors has further intensified its journey to conquer new peaks in the year 2021.

article_4015,"The parable of ‘blind men and an elephant’ increasingly seems to represent India’s agriculture policies, just as it previously did for India’s Industrialization.

Planning in silos coupled with tenured postings has denied India policy continuity, accountability and efficacy. Despite overwhelming precedence, Indian policy makers have failed to recognise that ensuring rural growth demands a multipronged policy thrust. Over 55% India resides in villages. Shifting rural youth to industrial or construction jobs; innovation in sustainable farm technologies, finance and productivity; vocational education and training and finally storage, logistics and accessible markets must all tango in tandem. Only then does rural growth move the wheels of consumption resulting in sustained GDP growth.

Japan, Taiwan and Korea followed the British model to get their villages engaged in a bottom up manufacturing value chain. This resulted in improved grounds up process innovation, increasing productivity and increased rural household incomes.

China’s policy pragmatism, within 35 years, pulled 850 million people out of poverty through grounds up development. Within China, rewarding meritocracy and ensuring policy continuity, despite political transitions, was ensured. Rural development policies ensured rural bank credit access, vocational training, gender equality, nutrition and healthcare push. In its first six years of opening up from 1979, over 23.5 million rural youth found employment. By 1995 numbers had catapulted to 135 million, while vocational training had been imparted to more than half its youth. This constituted China’s productive and low cost industrial spine. Simultaneously, Chinese urbanization and housing thrust engaged millions of youth in infrastructure and construction jobs. Lack of labour laws, and devaluing yuan in 1994, rushed global investments to barter inflation free western growth through cheaper Chinese goods. This surged China’s exports, GDP and employment.

In agriculture, China invested billions of dollars in enhancing yields through seed and process innovations. Direct farm subsidy provided on per hectare basis, ensured farmers freedom to grow and amounted to more than $20 billion two years ago. China’s innovation driven productivity in most crops is almost double of India’s. Such policy pragmatism has benefitted 800 million Chinese farmers directly resulting in the biggest human income upgrade in world history. India’s GDP was greater than China’s till 1970. India’s small land holdings, poor farm processes, illiteracy and lack of irrigation, process and innovation thrust has traditionally left farmers rain God dependent. India’s shame during PL-480 imports, led to food grain self-sufficiency through green revolution(GR) initiatives. No efforts were however made to undo the adverse impact of this revolution on soil fertility, fertilizer overdependence, loss of genetic diversity. Lack of irrigation connectivity resulted in huge depletion of ground water aquifers. GR success overwhelmed our focus on balanced diet through nutrition per capita. Ignoring concepts like scaling of farm yield and produce size standardization cost India global market access. Minimum support price benefitted less than 10% of high end farmers, denying equity to small and marginal ones.

Meanwhile, India’s industrial policies failed to draw rural youth into employment, thus increasing poverty pressure on growing rural households. This is the genesis of social rural conflicts across India.

India’s socialist tilt denied it access to western global industry or agricultural supply chains for inflow or upgradation of technologies. Lack of trained and low cost manpower reduced our export promotion policy to licence procurement and import manipulations.

In fact, India’s liberalisation story is direct opposite of China. Post 1991, industrial employment plummeted while imports and economy grew. Growing figures in industries hid the ugly fact that average employment remained stagnant around 2 persons per unit, till 2004.

Drastic import tariffs cuts, reduced most manufacturers into becoming import dependent. India’s obtuse labour laws, inspector raj and plethora of compliances ensured that industries shed jobs to employ machines. India’s policy’s fascination for large industries for creating jobs, was totally misplaced as large units preferred automation rather than labour strikes. In the name of labour protection policies, India killed labour accountability, productivity and serious greenfield investments. Lessons from west and east on generating employment via small industries were totally ignored. Policy euphoria over growth in services overlooked the fact that services cannot replace manufacturing for providing bulk employment. Instead, India’s services sector growth upset the wage equilibrium across manufacturing industries. Liberalisation wiped out many of local, yet globally competitive industries. All these reduced India into becoming import dependent on China.

During past two decades, irrational policies have resulted in labour productivity and wage decline. Productivity slid from 10.3% during 2006-10 to 3.7% during 2016-18, while industrial wages plummeted over 5% between during 2011-15 to 2016-18, resulting in demand deflation.

In agriculture, India with one sixth global population has only 4% of world fresh water resources. Over half of India’s cultivable area is small holdings and rain dependent. Nearly 125 million land owners averaging only 0.6 hectares of holding suffer from low productivity, enhanced input costs and reduced market access. Bank nationalization thrust to ensure rural credit percolation fizzled post 1991, when many rural branches closed. Thereafter local moneylender dependence has increased farmer suicides.

The impact of liberalisation on agriculture was even more devastating than industry. Public distribution system reforms and shifting to WTO from GATT, timed India’s increased import dependence of pulses and oilseeds due to inadequate production technology, low yields and inability to match import prices. Lack of Israel like focus on terrain compatible cultivars, inefficient harvesting and fertilization processes along with lack of innovation in high yield seeds has been accentuated by issues of shifting climate patterns, increasing varieties of plant pests and high credit cost, turning agriculture into a hugely risky business. Inadequate storage and logistic solutions added with frequent policy flip-flop on export or import deny any farmer the opportunity to reap benefits of good rains or bountiful harvest.

The constant tussle between environmentalists and infrastructure development have reduced job possibilities in infrastructure sector. Even when dams get completed, their last mile irrigation connectivity potential is hampered by project delays, resultant cost overruns and poor execution.Lack of policy focus on rural healthcare, education, training and investment in irrigation infrastructure has seen agriculture share in its GDP drop from 33% to 17 % between 1991 and today. Effective policy interventions like crop insurance, digital agricultural markets, income tax waivers, free electricity, subsidised fertilizer and MSP have failed to rejuvenate India's rural economy. Leakages and inefficiency is rampant in food procurement. FCI in 2019 procured paddy at Rs 17.50 per kg, which became Rs 36 per kg for rice. Local market price of rice was Rs 28 per kg. FCI resultantly lost Rs 6 per kg, while distributing it for Rs 2.

India needs a drastic policy planning turnaround by introducing a ground up approach rather than top down. Rural and urban nutrition priority must shift policy focus on vegetables, fruit, lentils, food grain, dairy, fish and meats for national nutrition security. A holistic, pan India, Gandhian Antyoday Rural Plan must be evolved by consensus with all stakeholders in states, state governments, seed companies, local agricultural institutes and diverse farm input providers as well as related industries. Soil and water mapping can help highlight input and infra facility gaps. Scientific growing, improved harvesting and storage practices, bio-tech solutions, water conservation and ground water recharge innovations, extending produce shelf life, soil conservation and cost saving initiatives must be identified, developed locally or imported to empower rural India into becoming a bountiful agricultural economy.

Laudable direct cash transfer(DCT) and e-market initiatives can be conjoined with innovative rural initiatives to bypass WTO restrictions on subsidies, while reducing farmers' uncertainties. About 20% of India’s current contract farmers must also be brought within DCTs ambit. India must end its cycle of poor crop yields that match its ineffective subsidies. A nationwide irrigation infrastructure can benefit from MNREGA funds to employ local villagers to create farm irrigation connectivity and ensure their maintenance. Shift in cropping habits from one geography to another must be carried out in a phased manner, in consultation with the stakeholders. MSP can thereafter be reduced by 10% each year while incentivising desired crop shifts through a lucrative subsidy.

For this, post offices can double up as banks for direct transfers and for deploying and disbursing various rural scheme funds for local area development. Farm related companies must be encouraged to educate local farmers on best practices in farm inputs, fertilizing, growth and storage while providing farm inputs on low interest credit, backed by post office payment guarantee. A regular appraisal of all policy initiatives, their efficacy and improvements must be carried out by farmer bodies in consultation with innovation institutes and seed and farm input providers. Policy makers must be excluded from micro planning and management.

Construction industry must be incentivised to ensure job creation and gainful migration and on-job training of rural unemployed. This will enhance rural household income, thereby triggering rural demand.

Public conflict with farmers breeds uncertainty and suspicion. What needs to be assured is that the immediate policy hardships would result in improved future for them and their next generation. Recall how Shastriji’s ""miss a meal a week"" initiative galvanized a hungry nation.

Great policy learnings can be acquired from the processes and institutional success of Operation Flood where over 75% of milk production comes from small and landless farmers, who finally retain approximately 70% of the consumer price. This price retention assurance has made this model a success, while benefiting over a 100 million farmer homes. A similar coordinated model for agriculture by encouraging district cooperatives, individual farmers, innovation institutions, state and central governments and linked rural stakeholders can shift India’s GDP gears to double figure growth.

article_4016,"The proposal to increase customs duty on certain imported automotive parts in the Union Budget 2020-21 will lead to increase in car prices, according to Merecedes-Benz India and Skoda Auto Volkswagen, even as component makers said the step will encourage local manufacturing of such items.

The government on Monday proposed an increase in customs duty on certain imported components used in automobiles.

In the Budget 2021-22, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed increase in customs duty of various parts, including ignition wiring sets, safety glass and parts of signalling equipment to 15 per cent with effect from February 2.

The parts would also attract agriculture infrastructure and development cess at the rate of 5 per cent.

Currently, the parts attract customs duty in the range of 7.5-10 per cent.

""The increase in the rise in auto component duties is unexpected in such a revival period, and it will increase the production cost, leading to higher cost for consumers,"" Mercedes-Benz India Managing Director and CEO Martin Schwenk said in a statement.

Besides, there could have been further push towards e-mobility by lowering import duties on electric vehicles, he added.

Similarly, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India Managing Director Gurpratap Boparai said the increase in customs duty on certain auto parts to 15 per cent will further increase input costs and prices for cars which depend on specialised components which cannot be manufactured locally due to unviable volumes.

It is important to keep in mind that even in the coming financial year, the passenger vehicle market is unlikely to reach the level of 2018 and the much-required rationalisation of GST and cess to aid the auto industry was missing, he added.

Both Schwenk and Boparai however welcomed the announcement of scrappage policy.

The government said the changes in basic customs duty is for creating level-playing fields for the benefit of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and other domestic manufacturers.

""We are raising custom duty on certain auto parts to 15 per cent to bring them on par with the general rate of auto parts,"" Sitharaman said in her Budget speech.

Automotive Component Manufacturers Association President Deepak Jain said the increase in basic customs duty on select auto components will encourage local manufacturing of such items.

Hailing the announcement of the scrappage policy, he noted that the announcements with regards increased spend on road infrastructure, voluntary scrappage policy, research and development and PLI among others, augur well for the automotive sector.

Similarly, Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) President Vinkesh Gulati said if 1990 is taken as a base year, there were around 37 lakh commercial vehicles and 52 lakh passenger vehicles eligible for voluntary scrapping.

""We still need to see the fine prints to access the kind of incentives which will be on offer and thus have a positive effect on retail,"" he added.

Hyundai Motor India Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) SS Kim said the proposed vehicle scrappage policy will provide thrust towards procurement of new automobiles and have a strong positive effect giving a boost to Atmanirbhar Bharat.

Tata Motors CEO and MD Guenter Butschek said voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and unfit vehicles, augmenting public transport system in urban areas, continuing focus on adoption of cleaner fuels, and enhancing outlays for developing road infrastructure are positive steps for the auto industry.

Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) Vice Chairman Vikram Kirloskar said the long-awaited scrapping policy could contribute to lower fuel consumption, lessen pollution while also generating additional demand for cleaner new vehicles.

""The auto sector welcomes this announcement and is hopeful that for realising full benefits there will be an early and full implementation of this policy,"" he added.

Similarly, Honda Cars India Senior Vice President & Director (Marketing and Sales) Rajesh Goel said the scrappage policy was one of the long-awaited announcements for the auto sector.

Expressing similar views, Renault India Operations Country CEO and Managing Director Venkatram Mamillapalle said the policy will significantly reduce pollution and should help bolster demand for new vehicles in the commercial and passenger vehicle sectors.

Mahindra & Mahindra MD and CEO Pawan Goenka said: ""Though details are not yet out, when the policy comes out, it should have full incentive for scrapping and not just disincentive for not scrapping.""



The Union has several positive signals for the manufacturing sector and the commercial vehicles (CV) sector, which are core to the economy, Ashok Leyland MD and CEO Vipin Sondhi said.

The Rs 18,000-crore scheme to augment public transport in urban areas with the addition of 20,000 new buses in a PPP model would ensure cleaner and efficient public transportation and ease congestion, he added.

Apollo Tyres Chairman Onkar S Kanwar also said the voluntary vehicle scrappage policy will provide the much-needed fillip to the auto and tyre industry.

Sitharaman on Monday announced the much-awaited voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and polluting vehicles.

Presenting the Budget for 2021-22 in Parliament, Sitharaman said that under voluntary vehicle scrapping policy, personal vehicles would undergo fitness tests after 20 years while commercial vehicles would require it after completion of 15 years.

Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gadkari said the policy will lead to new investment of around Rs 10,000 crore and create as many as 50,000 jobs.

He further said the policy would cover over 1 crore light, medium and heavy motor vehicles.

article_4017,"The finance minister had promised that this post-covid Budget will be like “one never seen before"". And she and the government have delivered. Acknowledging the severity of the economic loss, this is every bit a growth-oriented Budget as we could ever have expected. Yet, with fiscal prudence temporarily in abeyance, there is a commitment to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act and fiscal consolidation over the next five years.

A couple of measures are significant in scope and even radical: increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) limits for insurance firms from the existing 49% to 74%, as well as permitting foreign ownership and control, and particularly the proposal to privatize two public sector banks and one general insurance company.

In addition, the budget presents a compelling vision under the rubric of Atmanirbhar Bharat, seeking to leverage multiple proposals to boost both investment and demand. As a package, these will take India to a sustained high-growth path in the medium term. These include an aggressive roadmap for monetization of the government’s physical and financial assets, increased focus on affordable housing to boost the long backward and forward construction linkages, and measures to attract foreign capital, including tax holidays and exemptions for aircraft leasing companies at the GIFT City. Expenditure on health and well-being is proposed to be increased by 137%.

Growth and revenue assumptions are also realistic. Nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth for FY22 is forecast at 14.4%, which is likely to be an underestimate and, therefore, will help the fiscal maths.

Infrastructure capex is a key thrust area for the budget. Outlay on capital expenditures will increase to ?5.54 trillion in FY22 from ?4.12 trillion budgeted in FY21 (now revised up to ? 4.39 trillion). These spends will be augmented by financing from the Development Financial Institution proposed to provide long-term debt financing for infrastructure projects.

Following on with the measures to incentivize credit offtake, which have been a key pillar of the post-pandemic stimulus measures, the budget proposes asset reconstruction and management companies to take over existing stressed loans of public sector banks and then sell them to potential investors. While details of the structure and capitalization of these companies are awaited, and several thorny issues, such as valuations of the assets to be transferred, are awaited, this can potentially help to clean up bank books and increase credit offtake from a significant share of the banking sector. The budgeted allocation of ?20,000 crore for PSB recapitalization will also help.

In addition to the higher spends to support growth, the budget has also sought to improve sentiment and confidence. Reducing the window for reopening tax assessments from the present six years to three years, while limiting tax assessments in serious evasion cases only with concurrence of the highest-ranking tax officer will reduce uncertainty. The result of the progressive simplifications in filing tax returns has resulted in a large increase in returns filed over the past six years.

The budget attempts to further increase transparency. At least one large off-balance sheet item, small savings loans to Food Corp. of India for food subsidy, will now have a direct budgetary allocation. This is a further advance from the measure of enhanced disclosures in earlier budgets of borrowings by government agencies to fund the government of India schemes. This also partially explains the significant increase in spending announced in both the FY21 and FY22 Budgets.

There will be challenges in implementing the ambitious measures. Steps for fiscal consolidation to meet the target of a fiscal deficit less than 4.5% by FY26 will have to be thought out and implemented vigorously. On the revenue side, this will entail rising tax compliance, aggressive disinvestment and asset monetization, realizing taxes that are stuck in litigation and disputes. On the expenditure side, there will have to be expenditure rationalization to increase spending efficiencies.

This is one of the quinquennial budgets which coincide with the tabling of a Finance Commission report. More than ever before, federalism – fiscal as well as other dimensions – has become one of the crucial pillars for implementing reforms.

Note that the Agri Infra cess on petrol and diesel is price-neutral for consumers, being a replacement of a tax with a cess and not an additional charge and, hence, will not add to inflation. However, the higher spends entail a borrowing programme higher than expected. This will need to be managed, since the support from banks will likely be lower in FY22, with expected increase in credit demand. The Reserve Bank of India will need to lend support to manage any undue rise in bond yields and significant market disruptions, although it too will be constrained with the need to gradually drain liquidity over the next year. As is always the case, implementing the multiple and complex budget proposals will be crucial for translating the fiscal levels to sustained growth and will need a coordinated policy response between the Centre and state governments.

article_4019,"'Van Aanholt is good enough for Arsenal' - Hodgson speaks out on rumours linking Crystal Palace star with Emirates switch

The Eagles head coach thinks that the Dutchman has the quality to step up to another level, but does not know if he will move this month

Patrick van Aanholt is good enough to play for Arsenal according to Roy Hodgson, who has spoken out on rumours linking the Crystal Palace star with a switch to Emirates Stadium.

The Gunners are reportedly lining up a last-minute swoop for Van Aanholt, with Mikel Arteta currently short on cover for Kieran Tierney at left-back.

The Palace defender has spent the last four years of his career at Selhurst Park, racking up 123 appearances for the club across all competitions, but his current contract is due to expire in June.

Arsenal have until 11pm on Monday to tie up a deal for Van Aanholt, who produced a stellar display during Palace's 1-0 home win over Crystal Palace at the weekend.

Hodgson thinks the Dutchman is capable of making the grade at the Emirates, but claims to have heard nothing of a potential transfer across London for the full-back as of yet.

""No, nothing I know about. Is he good enough to play for Arsenal?"" the Eagles boss told the media on Monday. ""Yes, but it would be a real surprise to me.""

Ainsley Maitland-Niles filled in for Tierney when the Scotland international missed the 0-0 draw with Palace in the Premier League on January 14th through injury, but Arteta doesn't have many other options in a key position of the field.

It was suggested that Sead Kolasinac's return to Schalke earlier this month would force the Gunners to dip into the transfer market for fresh blood, but Martin Odegaard and Matt Ryan have been the only new arrivals so far, on loan deals from Real Madrid and Brighton respectively.

Arteta did not rule out further signings during his latest press conference, telling reporters: ""The last day of the transfer window is always unpredictable so things can happen. They might happen, they might not happen. We are on it.”

Arsenal are due back in top-flight action on Tuesday night, with a trip to Molineux to face Wolves on the cards. Arteta's side were held to a 0-0 draw by Manchester United in their last outing, but are now unbeaten in their last six Premier League games."
article_4020,"New Delhi, Feb 1 (PTI) Agri and food companies on Monday hailed the decision to hike farm credit target and increase allocation for the agriculture ministry in the Budget, saying this will help in boosting farmers' income and overall growth of the sector.

Asserting that the government is committed towards farmers' welfare, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday proposed 10 per cent hike in the farm loan disbursal target to Rs 16.5 lakh crore, and introduced an agri infra and development cess of up to 100 per cent to create post-harvest infrastructure for improving farmers' income.

The minister also proposed higher allocation for Rural Infrastructure Development Fund and Micro Irrigation Fund, and extended Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to APMCs for augmenting infrastructure facilities.

""2020 has been a year of exceptional and unprecedented challenges and has highlighted the critical importance of two core sectors, agriculture and healthcare. The Union Budget 2021 has correctly called out the role of these two sectors in leading the nation's recovery and being catalysts to sustainable growth,"" said D Narain, Senior Bayer Representative, South Asia and CEO & MD, Bayer CropScience.

Higher allocations for both healthcare and agriculture with specific focus on building public health infrastructure, expansion of credit to farmers, additional allocation for rural infrastructure and micro irrigation are welcome moves, he said.

""These initiatives complement actions already initiated to double farmers' incomes and enabling wider healthcare access for the nation,"" Narain added.

Ram Kaundinya, Director General, Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSII), said it is a status quo budget for agriculture in general and for seed industry in particular.

""Agriculture contributed significantly to our successful fight against COVID. But the sector did not get the needed attention in the budget. No transformative measures have been proposed,"" he said.

On the positives, Kaundinya said an increase in agricultural credit to Rs 16.5 lakh crore will help farmers in accessing more credit and Rs 10,000 crore for micro irrigation is also a good measure.

""Increasing import duty on cotton is a good measure that should help in improving domestic prices although we are no longer a major cotton importer. We are actually the largest exporter in the world, courtesy Bt Cotton driven increase in cotton production,"" he said.

Output marketing related measures like extending eNAM (National Agriculture Market) to 1,000 more mandis and making Agri Infrastructure Fund available for upgrading infrastructure in APMCs are welcome, FSII said.

On disappointments, Kaundinya said investments in research in agriculture are not addressed, especially since research and innovation is one of the six pillars of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and there is a need to scale up private sector investments in agricultural research.

Seed industry was expecting restoration of 200 per cent tax deduction of research expenses but it has not been met, he added.

The industry expected a major project to invest in scaling up domestic oilseeds production through incentives for farmers, use of modern technologies in crops like mustard, soybean and groundnut would be announced with an eye on reducing huge imports of edible oils, he said.

Maithili Appalwar, CEO, Avana, said: ""The proposed outlay of Rs 2.87 lakh crore under the Jal Jeevan Mission supports our vision of water conservation and sanitation. With agriculture taking a centre stage in this year's Budget, we appreciate the government's pragmatic measures of an influx of Rs 10,000 crore as part of the micro irrigation corpus fund, a double since last fiscal.""

article_4026,"New Delhi, Feb 1 (PTI) Agri and food companies on Monday hailed the decision to hike farm credit target and increase allocation for the agriculture ministry in the Budget, saying this will help in boosting farmers'' income and overall growth of the sector.

Asserting that the government is committed towards farmers'' welfare, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday proposed 10 per cent hike in the farm loan disbursal target to Rs 16.5 lakh crore, and introduced an agri infra and development cess of up to 100 per cent to create post-harvest infrastructure for improving farmers'' income.

The minister also proposed higher allocation for Rural Infrastructure Development Fund and Micro Irrigation Fund, and extended Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to APMCs for augmenting infrastructure facilities.

""2020 has been a year of exceptional and unprecedented challenges and has highlighted the critical importance of two core sectors, agriculture and healthcare. The Union Budget 2021 has correctly called out the role of these two sectors in leading the nation''s recovery and being catalysts to sustainable growth,"" said D Narain, Senior Bayer Representative, South Asia and CEO & MD, Bayer CropScience.

Higher allocations for both healthcare and agriculture with specific focus on building public health infrastructure, expansion of credit to farmers, additional allocation for rural infrastructure and micro irrigation are welcome moves, he said.

""These initiatives complement actions already initiated to double farmers'' incomes and enabling wider healthcare access for the nation,"" Narain added.

Ram Kaundinya, Director General, Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSII), said it is a status quo budget for agriculture in general and for seed industry in particular.

""Agriculture contributed significantly to our successful fight against COVID. But the sector did not get the needed attention in the budget. No transformative measures have been proposed,"" he said.

On the positives, Kaundinya said an increase in agricultural credit to Rs 16.5 lakh crore will help farmers in accessing more credit and Rs 10,000 crore for micro irrigation is also a good measure.

""Increasing import duty on cotton is a good measure that should help in improving domestic prices although we are no longer a major cotton importer. We are actually the largest exporter in the world, courtesy Bt Cotton driven increase in cotton production,"" he said.

Output marketing related measures like extending eNAM (National Agriculture Market) to 1,000 more mandis and making Agri Infrastructure Fund available for upgrading infrastructure in APMCs are welcome, FSII said.

On disappointments, Kaundinya said investments in research in agriculture are not addressed, especially since research and innovation is one of the six pillars of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and there is a need to scale up private sector investments in agricultural research.

Seed industry was expecting restoration of 200 per cent tax deduction of research expenses but it has not been met, he added.

The industry expected a major project to invest in scaling up domestic oilseeds production through incentives for farmers, use of modern technologies in crops like mustard, soybean and groundnut would be announced with an eye on reducing huge imports of edible oils, he said.

Maithili Appalwar, CEO, Avana, said: ""The proposed outlay of Rs 2.87 lakh crore under the Jal Jeevan Mission supports our vision of water conservation and sanitation. With agriculture taking a centre stage in this year''s Budget, we appreciate the government''s pragmatic measures of an influx of Rs 10,000 crore as part of the micro irrigation corpus fund, a double since last fiscal.""

Announcement of the agriculture credit target of Rs 16.5 lakh crore for FY22, green scheme as well as an increase in provision to rural infra development fund to Rs 40,000 crore from Rs 30,000 crore will ensure the spur in development and growth for farmers, Appalwar said.

Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he has been informed that his team were on the end of two wrong decisions during the 2-1 defeat to Sheffield United.

Solskjaer said an independent report issued as part of the match assessment by refereeing body PGMOL stated that Kean Bryan's opener for Sheffield United should have been chalked off for a foul on goalkeeper David De Gea while Anthony Martial's goal was wrongly disallowed at the other end.

- Transfer Deadline Day latest: ESPN's LIVE blog

""The momentum shifted for us with the Sheffield United game, but I've got the delegates' report from the ref and the two decisions were wrong,"" Solskjaer told a news conference on Monday.

""They've admitted their goal should have been disallowed and our goal should have stood. That's a big, big momentum changer for us. When you go 1-0 up rather than 1-0 down, go on and win that game.

""So that's fine margins and it has been the way this season, fine margins. You hit the post, it goes in or it goes out, sometimes you're lucky with decisions, sometimes you're not.""

After following up the defeat to Sheffield United with a 0-0 draw at Arsenal on Saturday, United are looking to bounce back against Southampton at Old Trafford on Tuesday.

""There's not been time to do a lot on the training pitch, the boys that played are still on the recovery track from Saturday night but they have to prepare for the game,"" Solskjaer said.

""We want to get that mojo back, that spark. We created enough chances to score the goals now it's about feeling good, taking a deep breath and putting the ball between the posts.""

Meanwhile, Solskjaer has ruled out any last minute signings on the final day of the transfer window.

Marcos Rojo is expected to sign for Boca Juniors while defender Teden Mengi is set to join Derby County on loan.

""We've made decisions we feel have been good for individuals and us as well, with the young players moving on, with [James] Garner, [Tahith] Chong, [Teden] Mengi and [Facundo] Pellistri getting the chance to play more football,"" Solskjaer added.

""Our group is a tight knit group, we don't have too many players in excess and hopefully Jesse [Lingard] can get going and play well at West Ham as well."""
article_4029,"FDI limit in Insurance sector increased from 49% to 74% and Foreign Ownership and control allowed with safeguards

While presenting the Union Budget 2021-22, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the Government will amend the Insurance Act, 1938 to increase the permissible FDI limit from 49% to 74% and allow foreign ownership and control with safeguards. Under the proposed new structure, the majority of Directors on the Board and key management persons would be resident Indians, with at least 50% of Directors being Independent Directors, and specified percentage of profits being retained as general reserve.

Stressed Asset Resolution by setting up a New Structure

The Finance Minister stated that an Asset Reconstruction Company Limited and Asset Management Company would be set up to consolidate and take over the existing stressed debt and then manage and dispose off the assets to Alternate Investment Funds and other potential investors for eventual value realization. The move will help the Public Sector Banks to manage their stressed assets.

Recapitalization of PSBs

In order to consolidate the financial capacity of Public Sectors Banks, the Government has proposed further recapitalization of Rs. 20,000 crore during the fiscal 2021-22.

Deposit Insurance

The Finance Minister further stated that the Government had, last year, approved an increase in the Deposit Insurance cover for bank customers from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 5 lakhs. In order to help depositors of banks that are currently under stress, the Government will move an amendment to the DICGC Act, 1961 in the current Parliament Session to streamline the provisions, so that if a bank is temporarily unable to fulfil its obligations, the depositors of such a bank can get easy and time-bound access to their deposits to the extent of the deposit insurance cover.

To improve credit discipline while continuing to protect the interest of small borrowers, for NBFCs with minimum asset size of Rs. 100 crores, the minimum loan size eligible for debt recovery under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 is proposed to be reduced from the existing level of Rs. 50 lakhs to Rs. 20 lakhs, the Minister added."
article_4030,"Parcel locker company InPost SA has clinched a five-year deal with Amazon Inc. as the U.S. giant enters Poland’s revved up $19 billion e-commerce market.

Fresh from last week’s successful initial public offering, InPost Chief Executive Officer Rafal Brzoska revealed the contract in an interview with Bloomberg. The Amsterdam-listed company will handle some Amazon deliveries in Poland through its network of automated lockers as well as directly to homes, he said.

The deal, which doesn’t cover shipments abroad, will help maintain InPost’s revenues if Amazon eats into the dominant position of Allegro.eu SA, the east European country’s e-commerce leader and the biggest client for its parcel lockers. The Polish company is boosting capacity to accommodate what it expects to be a gradual ramp-up of operations by the U.S. giant.

“We expect our friends from Amazon to pace their entry -- this is not going to be a Blitzkrieg,” Brzoska, 43, said by phone. Amazon’s step is “very positive, because it means increased volumes. For the entire market, it means faster e-commerce penetration.”

InPost shares gained as much as 3.1% and traded 1% higher at 10:42 a.m. in Amsterdam, while Allegro dropped 5.1% in Warsaw before recouping most losses. The Amazon-InPost deal shows that the U.S. giant has “serious plans” for Poland, and making use of a delivery method often preferred by Poles may help it grow, Erste Group Bank AG’s analyst Konrad Grygo said.

Lifestyle Change

Amazon last week invited sellers to start registering for its new Polish website that will go live soon. The move coincided with InPost’s market debut via a 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) IPO which turned Brzoska into a billionaire. The company jumped 24% since its listing and is worth 9.9 billion euros.

InPost, which has more than 10,000 lockers, plans to add 4,000 to 5,000 more this year, predicting market growth after better-than-expected volumes in the fourth quarter. The company isn’t changing its mid-term capex plan of as much as 625 million zloty ($168 million) per year after Amazon’s decision, the CEO said.

Brzoska is betting that Poles’ embrace of online shopping is a lifestyle change that will outlast the pandemic and that the eventual lifting of virus-related restrictions won’t be a big hit for InPost’s business model.

InPost shrugs off competition risk from companies that seek to encroach on its home turf, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s AliExpress, Poland’s post office and state-run refiner and retailer PKN Orlen SA. Even as these companies may install as many as 5,000 lockers in Poland over next few years, they would still lack the technology to undermine InPost’s position, he said.

Tech Tandem

While clinching the Amazon agreement, whose business or financial details haven’t been published, Brzoska remains confident about InPost’s relationship with Allegro.eu.

The two companies signed a seven-year delivery deal in September, even as Polish marketplace plans to launch its own machines. Brzoska wants to see such step as diversification only. About 70% of Allegro’s merchandise go through InPost lockers.

“We created a tandem that has generated the biggest tech IPOs in Europe,” he said. “We achieved so much together already and I believe we can achieve even more.”

Erste’s Grygo said he expects the entry of Amazon to potentially push Allegro toward foreign expansion so it can maintain its rapid growth.

Brzoska is also looking to expand in western Europe. InPost wants to double its U.K. network of automated lockers to 2,000 machines this year. In France, where about 40% of all online purchases are delivered through the out-of-home model, it will seek to buy logistic companies running pick-up and delivery chains in early 2021.

He said the pandemic has exposed the shortcomings of the western European model based on pick-up and drop-off points located in convenience stores or in cafés, which became overwhelmed during peak shopping seasons. That creates a lifetime opportunity for InPost.

“Merchants in Western Europe have reached their limits,” Brzoska said. “Pick-up points can serve about 20-40 parcels a day while our lockers even 700. Polish merchants have learned their lesson, now it’s time for Western Europe.”"
article_4031,"About 1,500 of the initial volunteers in a late-stage clinical trial of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine were given the wrong dose, but weren’t informed that a mistake had been made after the blunder was discovered, documents obtained by Reuters show.

Instead, the dosing mishap was presented to the trial participants in a letter dated June 8 as an opportunity for University of Oxford researchers to learn how well the vaccine works at different doses. The letter was signed by the trial’s chief investigator, Oxford professor Andrew J. Pollard, and sent to the trial subjects.

Read | EU regulator authorises AstraZeneca vaccine for all adults

As Reuters reported on Dec. 24, participants were given about a half dose due to a measuring mistake by Oxford researchers. The Pollard letter didn’t acknowledge any error. Nor did it disclose that researchers had reported the issue to British medical regulators, who then told Oxford to add another test group to receive the full dose, in line with the trial’s original plan.

There is no suggestion there was any risk to the health of trial participants.

Much is riding on the British-developed vaccine, which is being rolled out across the UK and has been touted as a low-cost weapon against the pandemic. The jab has come under scrutiny because of the dosing error in the Oxford trial and a paucity of data about its efficacy in older people who are most vulnerable to the virus.

Reuters shared the letter – which it obtained from the university through a Freedom of Information request – with three different experts in medical ethics. The ethicists all said it indicates the researchers may not have been transparent with trial participants. Volunteers in clinical trials are supposed to be kept fully informed about any changes.

“They are not clear at all about what they need to be clear about – what’s going on, what they knew, the rationale for undertaking further research,” said Arthur L. Caplan, founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University Grossman School of Medicine. “It is lost in a snowstorm of verbiage.”

Steve Pritchard, a spokesman for Oxford, told Reuters: “The half-dose group was unplanned, but we did know in advance that there was a discrepancy in the dose measurements and discussed this with the regulators before dosing and when the dosing was revised.”

Pritchard also said, “We have not stated that a dosing error occurred.”

Pollard didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The spokesman’s suggestion that no error was made is contradicted by documents produced last year by Oxford and its vaccine partner, drugs giant AstraZeneca PLC. In December, Reuters reported that a “Global Statistical Analysis Plan” by Oxford/AstraZeneca, dated Nov. 17 and later published in the scientific journal The Lancet, called the dosing discrepancy “a potency miscalculation.”

A spokesman for AstraZeneca declined to comment.

The Health Research Authority, a British government agency responsible for approving medical research and ensuring it is ethical, said in a statement that changes to the study design and the letter sent to participants were approved by one of its ethics committees.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine recently has received authorization for use in a growing number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the European Union and India. The UK became the first country to approve it, and began rolling out the vaccine on January 4.

But questions surrounding the clinical trials continue to plague the vaccine. Last week, Germany’s vaccine committee recommended it should only be given to people aged under 65, while the EU, which authorized it on Friday for people aged 18 and over, lowered its reported efficacy rate from 70.4% to 60%. In both cases, authorities cited a lack of sufficient data from the clinical trials. The EU also has sharply criticized AstraZeneca for cutting back its planned vaccine deliveries to the continent over the next few months. The company has said it is doing its best to boost supplies.

The mistaken half-dose – which prompted the letter in June to trial participants – continues to be a factor in the reported efficacy of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

Oxford had reported interim results in November that showed the efficacy rate for trial subjects who mistakenly received a half-dose and a subsequent full-dose booster shot was 90%, and that the rate for those who received two full doses was 62%. Combining data from the two dosing regimens resulted in an efficacy of 70.4%.

In authorizing the vaccine, UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), accepted the pooled results, but didn’t approve administering the half-dose/full-dose regimen. “There is not persuasive evidence of a real difference in” vaccine efficacy between the two different dosing regimens, it said.

“RECENT CHANGES”

The vaccine’s late-stage clinical trial began on May 28. Within days, Oxford researchers realized trial participants had been given lower doses than planned after they displayed milder than expected side effects, such as fever and fatigue. They alerted British medical regulators.

On June 5, the researchers amended the trial protocol at the request of regulators to add a new group that would receive the correct full dose of the vaccine. Three days later, they alerted trial subjects to what they called “recent changes in the study” in a two-page letter attached to an updated 13-page “Participant Information Sheet.”

The letter, signed by chief investigator Pollard, stated that researchers “are not sure what dose of vaccine is most likely to be protective against COVID disease” and explained that doses “are measured using standard scientific test methods.” It said the late-stage trial participants received a dose measured using one method and that another group will receive a dose measured using a different test to match the dose given in another clinical trial of the vaccine.

It said the lower dose is “still in the normal range of doses that are used in clinical trials” and “if it can provide protection, it might be better for use in vaccine programmes.”

Caplan said the explanation would be of “no interest whatsoever to the subject because it’s too technical. To me, that qualifies as gobbledygook. What you want to know is, why are they doing this, we made an error, it involved dosing, we’re not worried about it.”

He and other ethicists interviewed by Reuters said researchers are obligated to be forthcoming with test subjects when things go wrong.

“As a letter purporting to explain a) an error and b) a change of protocol I find this entirely inadequate,” said Simon Woods, a professor of bioethics at Newcastle University, in an email. “It reads like a routine update (and a complex one at that).”

Emma Cave, a professor of healthcare law at Durham University’s law school, said: “Presenting the dosing variation as a planned change in the study is potentially a breach of trust if in fact the dosing resulted from an error. The letter makes clear the dosing change but not the reason for the change.”"

Former TMC MLA Rajib Banerjee, who recently joined the BJP, has been provided with ‘Z’ category security in West Bengal by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The former Bengal minister has also been provided with ‘Y+’ category security across the country.

After quitting the TMC on Friday last week, Banerjee had joined the BJP on Saturday, along with four other TMC rebels.

Domjur MLA Rajib Banerjee had been airing his grievances against a section of TMC party leaders over the past few weeks. He has now joined the string of TMC leaders and legislators who recently quit the Mamata Banerjee camp and joined the BJP.

The security cover provided to Banerjee comes after vehicles of BJP leaders JP Nadda and Kailash Vijayvargiya’s convoys were attacked in Bengal in December last year.

Following the attack, BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya was provided with Z category security. Vijayvargiya was also provided with a bulletproof car.

article_4033,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today did not announce big changes in income tax rules in Budget 2021. However, she announced some tweaks in income tax rules, including on ULIPs, employee's contribution to provident fund for high income earners and easing of income tax return filing for senior citizens.

Here are five changes in income tax changes announced in Budget 2021:

1) In order to rationalise tax exemption for high income employees, Budget 2021 proposed to restrict tax exemption for the interest income earned on the employees’ contribution to various provident funds to the annual contribution of ?2.5 lakh. Accordingly, any interest earned on employee contribution to pf above 2.5 lakh is now taxable. This provision shall be applicable for the contribution made on or after April 1.

2) Budget 2021 has proposed not to provide tax exemption under section 10(10D) of Income Tax Act for maturity proceeds of the unit-linked insurance policies (Ulips) with annual premium above ?2.5 lakh. According to the Budget proposals, for ULIPs taken on or after February 1, the maturity proceeds of policies with an annual premium of more than ?2.5 lakh will be taxable at par with equity-linked mutual fund schemes.

Currently, long-term capital gains (LTCG) arising out of the sale of listed equity shares and units of equity-oriented mutual fund schemes are now taxed at the rate of 10%, if the LTCG exceed ?1 lakh in a financial year ( gains up to January 31, 2018 being grandfathered).

Short term capital gains (if the units are sold before one year) in equity mutual funds are taxed at the rate of 15%.

3) Senior citizens of 75 years and above having pension income and interest from fixed deposit in the same bank would not be required to file income tax returns for the financial year beginning April 1.

In the Budget Speech 2021-22, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that in the 75th year of Independence of our country, the government shall reduce compliance burden on senior citizens who are 75 years of age and above.

""The Union Budget announced by Finance Minister had flavours of the past budgets i.e. provide relief to senior citizens and tax HNIs. Going forward senior citizens above the age of 75 years will not be required to to file a income tax return provided they only have pension and interest income and have fulfilled specified criteria. On the other hand, interest earned on an accrual basis for employee contribution to PF above ?2.5 lakh will now be taxable. Further, income received on ULIPs where annual premium is more than ?2.5 lakh will now be taxable and treated at par with equity mutual funds,"" said Nitin Baijal, director at Deloitte.

4) The government in Budget 2021 extended the additional tax deduction of ?1.5 lakh on interest paid on housing loan for purchase of affordable homes by one more year to March 31, 2022,. The additional deduction of ?1.5 lakh over and above ?2 lakh was introduced in the 2019 budget. This was allowed for those buying homes for the first time and of up to ?45 lakh.

The additional deduction of ?1.5 lakh shall therefore be available for loans taken up till March 31, 2022, for the purchase of an affordable house.

“The announcement of a 1-year tax holiday for affordable housing projects and a 1-year extension for an additional deduction of interest up to ?1.5 lakh on loan for affordable housing will boost prospects for the housing and real estate industry,"" said Nish Bhatt, Founder & CEO, Millwood Kane International.

5) Budget 2021 proposed to insert a new section 206AB in the Income Tax Act as a special provision providing for higher rate for TDS for the non-filers of income-tax return.

The proposed TDS rate in this section is higher of the followings rates:-

Twice the rate specified in the relevant provision of the Act; or

twice the rate or rates in force; or

the rate of five per cent

Reddit’s storming of the stock market has sparked jitters among professional investors about the fundamental strength of the market, with bubble talk spiking over the last week.

Reddit users from the r/WallStreetBets forum last week masterminded a short squeeze on professional investors that were betting against stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC), forcing several hedge funds to swallow billions in losses. The action moved to the silver (SI=F) market on Monday.

The events have spiked anxiety among professional investors, with concerns that the stress could spread to the broader market. Some investors were already convinced that a bubble had formed and think this new band of retail warriors could pop it.

“Market commentators point to increasing signs of froth as evidence that the equity market is in the late stage of a bubble, which is set to burst soon,” Bank of America’s European equity strategy team wrote in a recent note.

Echoes of dotcom bubble

After slumping in March as the pandemic first struck, US stock markets surged to record highs last year despite a collapse in global growth.

“The US stock market has only been this highly valued twice before: during the Dot Com Bubble in the late 1990s and before the 1929 market crash signalling the beginning of the Great Depression,” said William Ryder, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. He cited the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a closely watched metric of valuation.

Bulls argue sky-high valuations reflect the bumper growth potential for the US economy once the worst of the pandemic passes. The IMF expects the US to grow by 5.1% this year. Earnings growth that should follow would justify today’s valuations.

Not everyone is convinced. Veteran investor Jeremy Grantham, the cofounder of $64bn (£47bn) asset manager GMO, wrote at the start of last month: “The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble.”

“I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history, right along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000,” he wrote, decrying “extreme overvaluation” and “hysterically speculative investor behavior.” This was before r/WallStreetBets started pushing up prices of loss making, old school businesses like GameStop and AMC.

Story continues

GameStop's wild ride. Chart: Yahoo Finance

Sceptics like Grantham argue that cheap money from central banks and low interest rates have combined to inflated a huge bubble in the stock market. The problem has only been exacerbated by stimulus checks and furlough payments made to people stuck at home with little to spend money on.

“For me, there is little doubt that huge central bank liquidity and government stimulus cheques in the hands of the underemployed/furloughed (through no fault of their own) retail investors will be a big part of this bubble story,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid wrote.

GameStop has had a wild ride on Wall Street as the stock has been heavily traded - some say manipulated - by hedge fund managers short-selling shares while Redditors (registered users of the website Reddit) have utilized social media to artificially inflate the value of the stock. Photo: STRF/STAR MAX/IPx 2020/AP

Research in the UK by Boscobel & Partners and FindOutNow estimated that 400,000 new investors joined the market in Britain last year, investing an estimated £20bn between them. Most were young men who were more likely to be furloughed than traditional investors. The newer crowd were also more likely to get their investment ideas from social media than more traditional sources.

‘A warning’

Some fear this wave of retail money could bring the stock market crashing down. Traditional investors, spooked by the anarchistic tendencies of the Redditors, may flee to safer corners like the bond market. Hedge funds hit by losses may be forced to liquidate profitable positions to cover their losses, feeding into the selling. And, when Redditors get bored and move on, many stocks will come crashing back to earth.

“Retail exuberance is a warning,” Barclays’ head of European equity strategy Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note last week.

If prices do start to turn, the mechanics of the rally mean it could unravel fast.

Dow Jones slump and then recovery to record highs. Chart: Yahoo Finance

“Derivative markets continue to mushroom and so does the use of margin debt – the latter once more stands near record-highs according to data from the New York Stock Exchange,” said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell.

Margin debt is money borrowed from a broker to buy securities. The use of borrowed money means that people could be forced to sell out quickly to cover themselves once the market starts to turn, rather than hold losing positions in the hope that they can ride out the volatility.

“History shows that confidence soon evaporates if the market stumbles and you could argue that the liquidation (forced or voluntary) of positions bought on margin accentuates any subsequent market decline,” Mould said.

“It is here that the greatest dangers may lie today, in these over-the-counter, lightly regulated, trillion-dollar markets, which are funded by leverage.”

WATCH: Silver swept up by GameStop retail frenzy

For now, most analysts see a large scale stock market collapse as a relatively small risk. Despite raising the bubble question, both Barclays and Bank of America said r/WallStreetBets was unlikely to tank the market.

“The recent run-up in equity prices is not so much a bubble, but rather the pre-pricing of the extremely strong growth conditions that are likely to materialize this year,” Bank of America said.

Deutsche Bank’s Reid said: “My personal view is that when the history books of this pandemic and its impact on financial markets will be written, they will have a significant chapter but more as a story of the bubble-like tendencies in certain parts of the market, rather than the main market event.”

However, Wall Street and the City should start paying more attention to the retail market even if the events of the past few days are largely a sideshow.

r/WallStreetBets has attracted millions of new followers over the last week, suggesting the movement’s momentum is unlikely to fade soon. And, more broadly, retail money has played a fundamental role in pushing up the price of bigger name stocks such as Tesla (TSLA), which rose over 700% last year. Tesla, now part of the S&P 500 (^GSPC), is much more systematically important than the “memestocks” targeted by Reddit last week.

“I think this movement does create some systemic risks but it is perhaps a smaller version of the risks associated with some of the eye watering valuations elsewhere in large corners of the technology sector,” Reid said.

“Retail has in many parts driven such valuations in the last 10 months. If this pops the wider market will have bigger issues than last week.”"

article_4039,"French manufacturer, Citroen has finally unveiled their India-specific C5 Aircross SUV. While prices are yet to be announced, the brand’s entry into India will be marked by the SUV which is being offered in a single diesel engine but in two trim levels: Feel and Shine.

Citroen is manufacturing the C5 Aircross locally at the company’s facility in Tamil Nadu with the eventual goal of reaching 90 percent localisation.

In terms of design, we get to see Citroen’s unique language. While the final silhouette is that of a conventional SUV, there are geometric patterns littered throughout the car. The front sports a split headlamp unit, both connected with horizontal lines. While the lower lines form the grille, the upper lines converge in the middle into the brand’s logo. Off to the side, you have the Airbumps and at the rear, you get tail lamp squares filled with more squares and the trapezoidal exhausts below that.

Powering the SUV is a 2-litre diesel engine that churns out 177 PS of power and 400 Nm of torque. This will be mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox. Citroen has also added in their Progressive Hydraulic Cushion equipped suspension. This, the company claims will be able to filer out bumps and dips in the road allowing for a better cabin experience.

On the inside, the geometric theme continues. Features include a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, keyless entry, dual-zone climate control, electrically adjustable driver’s seat, recline adjustable and slidable rear seats. The car also gets cruise control, powered and heated OVRMs, puddle lamps, auto headlamps and rain sensing wipers. The top variant, Shine on the other hand also gets LED headlamps, panoramic sunroof and a powered tail gate.

Safety features are also top-of-the-line with blind spot monitoring (a segment-first feature), auto parking, reverse camera, tyre pressure monitoring, six airbags, driver attention monitor, hill-start assist, ABS, traction control and ISOFIX child seat mounts.

The Citroen C5 Aircross is expected to launch sometime late February to early March and will go up against the likes of the Toyota Fortuner, Ford Endeavour and the upcoming Volkswagen Tiguan. Expect a price near the Rs 30 lakh mark. The C5 Aircross is expected to be the first from Citroen with a new car lined for each year under the company’s C-Cubed programme."
article_4040,"New Delhi, Feb 1 (PTI) Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday welcomed the Union Budget for 2021-22, saying priority has been given to doubling farmers'' income by focusing on making available higher farm credit and post-harvest infrastructure in rural areas.

""I welcome the budget. It is a good budget that focuses on all sections of the society. Better fund allocation has been made for each sector which will benefit farmers and rural India,"" Tomar told reporters.

For instance, the farm loan target has been increased to Rs 16.5 lakh crore for the 2021-22 fiscal from Rs 15 lakh crore this financial year while the Rs 1 lakh crore agriculture infrastructure fund would be made available for strengthening APMCs, he said.

Stating that the government is committed to farmers'' welfare, Tomar said, ""The government is making efforts towards achieving the target of doubling farmers'' income by 2022. The priority has been given for this in the budget.""

When asked about some political parties protesting against the budget in Parliament saying the government presented a digital budget when internet has been snapped at the farmers'' protest site at Delhi borders, Tomar said, ""I want to urge such political parties not to politicise the matter. Those who look for opportunities for doing politics, their plight will be that of Opposition parties"".

On agri-infrastructure and development cess, the minister said it will not have an impact on consumers. The fund raised through the cess will be used for development of post-harvest infrastructure, which is much needed for enhancing farmers'' income.

Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Choudhary also lauded the budget saying it benefits all sections of people and the allocation made for the sector is much higher than what was there during the UPA time.

The budget allocation and several measures taken in the farm sector will benefit farmers and enhance their income, he said.

The minister also said that sufficient funds have been allocated for agricultural research and education and if needed more can be sought later. PTI LUX RAM

article_4042,"Let’s eliminate one thing. You won’t agree with every selection from the TBEN list of the 100 Most Notable People on Blockchain.

In fact, you’ll almost certainly disagree, vehemently, with many of the people we’ve included in this year’s list.

You will rage at the inclusion of [insert comedy villain here] and the exclusion of, say, Charles Hoskinson. Especially if you are Charles Hoskinson.

You’ll be bubbling over with the fact that Arthur Hayes is nowhere to be found. (We watched.) You’ll eat your own … words, because you tweeted once that John McAfee was a shoo-in.

And despite your fury at the absence of delicious Charlie Lee, and the presence of [really, that guy?] we risk our Top 100 being the most comprehensive, most studied … and undoubtedly controversial selection in the blockchain industry.

Our inclusion criteria this year recognizes that the TBEN Top 100 is not a crypto Who’s Who. No one is guaranteed a position based on their reputation. Instead, it refers to those whose choices over the past year have had a major impact on the industry, or on whom we expect to be particularly influential in 2021.

His disrespect for the “ establishment ” of crypto, if such a thing can exist in an industry barely over a decade old, is reflected in the fact that there are an astonishing 75 new entrants on this year’s list.

Even more surprising is the fact that not a single person from last year’s Top 10 kept their place at the top of this year’s list – and five of them left our Top 100 entirely.

Our list, compiled with input from the entire TBEN editorial team, is not an endorsement of the people on it, nor a celebration of every achievement. We don’t like black hat hackers, but you can’t deny the impact they have had on our industry.

And while it’s somewhat western-centric, it’s a deliberate choice since some of our regional editions have created their own lists. It should also be noted that we did not have quotas on diversity and inclusion, despite vigorous internal debate; the list is meritocratic, although we continue to be surprised and disappointed at the rate at which under-represented groups are entering the sector.

That said, we’re encouraged that women now make up 24% of the top 50 – a significant increase from 10% in 2020.

VISIT THE NOTABLE TBEN 100

Our list includes ten people from each of our ten categories:

Founders

In preparing our list of founders, we must necessarily choose those whose ideas have started to materialize. These are people who have shown they have the patience and stamina to be successful, as well as the urge to innovate.

Investors

The numbers on our investor roster often act as a bridge between blockchain and the mainstream financial world, and the more investors join the ranks of crypto, the closer the industry gets to widespread adoption.

Challenge

The Top DeFi Personalities List attempts to shine a light on this diverse roster of characters. In their – often surprisingly – different ways, each of them has made a contribution to the space in 2020, and many will continue to shape DeFi’s future.

Defenders

We’re talking about rockstars, influencers, sports figures, OG tech assistants, converts from mainstream finance, and creatives of all stripes – even a captain – each with a shared desire to spread a common vision according to which distributed technology is the way we move humanity forward.

Media, data and research

Some of the numbers we’ve highlighted in our Media, Data, and Research category are well known in the media, from crypto influencers and podcasters to cable TV hosts. Others run data analysis companies or aggregators that help us separate signal from noise. And there are a few personalities who work mostly behind the scenes, at the head of influential companies and research funds.

The steps

The people we have highlighted in our Markets category represent the most talented and resourceful analysts in the industry. Some have the uncanny ability to forecast macro market movements with a succinct single chart posted to Twitter, while others look at bitcoin’s on-chain activity to develop elaborate metrics aimed at institutional and long-term investors.

Exchange

Those chosen for our Exchange category this year have responded to scaling challenges and emerging financial models in a variety of ways, including increasing server capacity, improving user experience, and deploying solutions like as the Bitcoin Lightning network, side chains and decentralized exchange protocols.

Adoption

For our Adoption category, we’ve highlighted the people in crypto who create and support products that go mainstream, as well as those who help us remember why we’re here in the first place. These numbers have found real use cases for the relatively young digital asset class and are dedicated to solving real-world problems with cryptocurrencies.

Law and politics

As adoption progresses, governments are becoming more involved in setting the rules of the road. Given how great the new crypto is and how much blockchain could fundamentally decentralize data essential to the functioning of governments, the laws and regulations surrounding the industry are changing rapidly. The people in our Law and Politics category come from both the public and private sectors, but they are united in that they have pushed for the most tangible legal breakthroughs for the crypto industry.

Technology

Some are dedicated to rectifying some of the blockchain flaws, while others are still bringing privacy solutions to public registries and beating hackers and exploiters against vulnerable smart contracts. Bitcoin was designed with supreme grace and elegance – it’s a wonder that will likely last for centuries. But on the back of the blockchain, there is more to build, and these developers are doing just that.

The Notable 100 will be released in sets of ten, starting at # 100, every day from Monday February 1 until the Top Ten announcement on Wednesday February 10.

We hope you enjoy it – despite how clearly we were wrong about the vital contributions of this person whom we excluded because we are so ridiculously biased.

Don’t worry, we’ll have them next year."
article_4043,"DeAndre Yedlin has joined Galatasaray on a free transfer from Newcastle.

The U.S. men's national team defender has signed a deal with the Turkish giants that runs until summer 2023 and will net him around €2.6 million ($3.1m/£2.3m).

The right-back spent four and a half years at Newcastle, having joined from Tottenham in 2016, and made six Premier League appearances for Steve Bruce's side this season.

Bruce admitted there was no place in the squad for the former Seattle Sounders man, saying: ""Quite simply we have had three right-backs at the club now and DeAndre is suited to wing-back. It’s been no secret that we have made changes to a back four.

""I want to wish him best of luck playing in Turkey for a huge club like Galatasaray. He's a great professional and a great lad.

“Sometimes you have to let one out to bring somebody in so it could be a busy day for us.""

Yedlin took to Instagram to bid farewell to the Magpies, writing: ""Been a pleasure [Newcastle]... made some great friends and memories over the last 4.5 years! Love to the fans for making me feel welcome from day 1! Wish nothing but the best for the club in the future!""

Yedlin is just one of three signings Galatasaray confirmed on Monday.

The Super Lig side have also confirmed the signing of Gedson Fernandes on loan from Benfica, having agreed to pay the Portuguese side €500,000 ($603,000/£441,000), while the player will pocket €650,000 ($784.000/£574,000).

Fernandes joined Tottenham on loan from Benfica in January 2020 and was supposed to stay at the north London side until the end of the season.

But the 22-year-old midfielder was unable to secure a place in Jose Mourinho's team. After making seven appearances in the Premier League last term, he did not feature in the English top-flight in 2020-21.

Mostafa Mohamed has joined on loan from Egyptian side Zamalek until summer 2022. Galatasaray paid €1.6m ($1.93m/£1.4m) upfront for the loan and have an option to buy him for €3.3m ($4m/£2.9m) when the deal expires.

They will pay the player €900,000 ($1.1m/£795,000) before signing him to a permanent deal."

article_4047,"Diabetes during pregnancy may increase risk of heart disease

NewMediaWire2021-02-01

Research Highlights:

An analysis of more than 1,000 women found that a history of gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) doubled the risk of heart artery calcification – a marker of increased risk for heart disease – many years after pregnancy, at the average age of 48, even if blood sugar returned to healthy levels.

Health care systems should integrate women’s history of gestational diabetes into health records so that health care professionals do not wait until these women develop overt Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes to initiate prevention efforts.

Embargoed until 4 a.m. CT/5 a.m. ET Monday, Feb. 1, 2021

(NewMediaWire) - February 01, 2021 - DALLAS - Women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) are twice as likely by mid-life to develop calcium in heart arteries – a strong predictor of heart disease – even if healthy blood sugar levels were attained many years after pregnancy, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association’s flagship journal Circulation.

Gestational diabetes, which is high blood sugar levels (glucose intolerance) first recognized during pregnancy, affects approximately 9% of U.S. pregnancies and up to 20% worldwide. After pregnancy, women who had gestational diabetes are at higher risk of developing prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes, conditions that are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Previous studies found a much higher risk of heart disease in women with a history of gestational diabetes who later developed Type 2 diabetes. However, it remained unclear whether heart disease risk among women with a history of gestational diabetes was lower for women who attained healthy glucose levels or who developed prediabetes in mid-life.

In 2018, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guidelines specified that a history of gestational diabetes enhances women’s risk for artery build-up that leads to cardiovascular disease.

Using data from the multicenter, 30-year prospective Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adult (CARDIA) study, researchers investigated whether attaining healthy blood sugar levels after pregnancy would mitigate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease that is associated with a history of gestational diabetes.

“CARDIA is the first study to assess heart disease risk in women with a history of gestational diabetes compared to those without gestational diabetes according their blood sugar levels many years later. Women with previous gestational diabetes had a twofold higher risk of coronary artery calcium if they maintained normal blood sugar levels, later developed prediabetes, or later were diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes many years after pregnancy compared to women without previous gestational diabetes who had normal blood sugar levels,” said Erica P. Gunderson, Ph.D., M.S., M.P.H., epidemiologist and senior research scientist in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Conditions Section at Kaiser Permanente’s Division of Research in Oakland, California.

The CARDIA study enrolled more than 5,100 U.S. men and women who were aged 18-30 years at the beginning of the study in 1985. The new analysis includes approximately 1,100 women (49% Black women and 51% white women) without Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who subsequently gave birth at least once during the 25-year study period, which ended in 2011. Blood tests were performed from before to after pregnancies at five-year intervals to determine if women had normal blood sugar levels, intermediate elevations in blood sugar levels (prediabetes) or they had developed overt Type 2 diabetes. Heart scans were performed to measure coronary artery calcium, a strong predictor for heart disease, at exams 15, 20 and 25 years after the baseline, the first exam of the study.

At the 25-year follow-up, the participants’ median age was 48 years old, and 12% of the women in the study had a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes. The prospective analysis found:

Women with a history of gestational diabetes had a two-fold higher risk of coronary artery calcification whether they had healthy blood sugar levels, prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes.

Attaining healthy blood sugar levels after pregnancy did not decrease the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in mid-life for women with previous gestational diabetes.

Of women with previous gestational diabetes, 36% developed prediabetes and 26% developed Type 2 diabetes, compared to 35% and 9% of women with no history of gestational diabetes.

25% of women with a history of gestational diabetes had some level of coronary artery calcium vs. 15% of women who never had gestational diabetes.

“We were surprised to discover that women with a history of gestational diabetes are at a significantly greater risk of heart artery calcification, even if they maintain normal blood sugar levels after pregnancy,” Gunderson said.

“Our findings represent a shift in this paradigm by showing that normal blood glucose after gestational diabetes is still related to higher coronary artery calcium risk,” the authors note.

“Risk assessment for heart disease should not wait until a woman has developed prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes,” Gunderson said. “Diabetes and other health problems that develop during pregnancy serve as early harbingers of future chronic disease risk, particularly heart disease. Health care systems need to integrate the individual’s history of gestational diabetes into health records and monitor risk factors for heart disease, as well as the recommended testing for Type 2 diabetes in these women at regular intervals, which is critical to target prevention efforts.”

Limitations of the study include that researchers had no measurement of coronary artery calcium levels prior to pregnancy, and coronary artery calcium scores were used as a surrogate marker for heart disease risk not cardiovascular events.

article_4049,"I’m not going to attract a straight line between the absence of a captain and the Dust-Up within the Tunnel between Tony DeAngelo and Alex Georgiev following Saturday evening’s additional time defeat to the Penguins that has rocked the franchise’s world and all however actually signaled the top of No. 77’s Broadway run.

Mark Messier, Vic Hadfield, Barry Beck, Ron Greschner and Ryan Callahan might all have been carrying the sweater and the “C” on Saturday and they’d not have been capable of forestall the spontaneous combustion that occurred.

But I do imagine that the Rangers, who appear to be coping with all kinds of points as they battle to seek out equilibrium out of the gate and get well the constructive 2019-20 vibes they apparently left behind within the Toronto bubble, do want a captain. I believe they do want an identifiable chief among the many management group.







And at this juncture, there isn’t a higher man for the job than Chris Kreider, who in his tenth year with the group has emerged because the voice of the group.

Prior to the season, the hierarchy that features president John Davidson, normal supervisor Jeff Gorton, head coach David Quinn and assistant GM Chris Drury, concluded that the group would profit from going with 4 alternates relatively than one captain. That implied that the group didn’t imagine that Kreider or presumptive main candidate Mika Zibanejad had been correct suits.

With that in thoughts, a few weeks in the past I urged that Jacob Trouba can be a logical candidate to fill the publish beginning with subsequent season. That got here within the wake of the defenseman having been lauded by Quinn for his work within the room following the opening evening 4-0 debacle of a defeat to the Islanders.

That was just a bit over two weeks in the past, even when it looks like a decade has handed since then. Good Ship Ranger has been springing leaks one after one other and is at risk of turning into the S.S. Minnow. Of course the coach goes to be in the end held accountable for the vessel’s destiny. But a powerful and distinguishable first mate goes to be wanted, too.

And that might be Kreider, who has had blue blood operating by his veins since becoming a member of the Rangers initially of the 2012 playoffs simply a few days off the BC Chestnut Hill campus.

There could also be administration considerations — there actually had been by No. 20’s early life — that Kreider internalizes an excessive amount of, worries an excessive amount of and that the captaincy would turn into a burden for him.

But the expansion in Kreider’s stature has been regular even when consistency on the ice stays elusive. Saturday, visibly upset (and now we all know why there was purpose to be, past the result) on the Zoom name with the media, Kreider referred to as the group out for its woebegone efficiency in letting one other third-period lead get away.

This wasn’t Kreider in his locker talking softly to a person journalist in an effort to get the message out. This was Kreider utilizing his platform to inform his teammates that it simply hasn’t been ok. And realizing Kreider, it’s all however sure that he despatched that message immediately earlier than blasting it into our on-line world, the place it is going to stay for all eternity or till the cloud is full.

Chris Kreider NHLI by way of Getty Images

It is one factor to have 4 alternates in Zibanejad, Kreider, Trouba and Artemi Panarin, but when there may be one captain, then he turns into the singular particular person accountable for setting the bar. He turns into the participant accountable for confronting teammates if the hassle is just not ok.

There have been all kinds of untamed tales circulating by the web the final two days concerning DeAngelo and his supposedly diseased relationship with Okay’Andre Miller. We have been instructed by quite a few people that there’s nothing to them and as an alternative innovations to go well with a story.

The Rangers are anticipated to vigorously refute these tales throughout a press briefing earlier than Monday’s rematch on the Garden towards the Penguins. Teams throughout professional sports activities have a tendency to circle the wagons in cases equivalent to these, however it could behoove Davidson and the hierarchy to offer as a lot transparency as doable right here in an effort to counteract tales which have begun to achieve forex.

(In addition, there are tales circulating that Kreider punched DeAngelo within the face after the preliminary imbroglio was damaged up by Miller, as The Post reported Monday morning. That is just not true, in response to a number of people with data of the state of affairs.)

A younger group with a nonetheless young-in-NHL expertise coach is within the midst of a disaster of confidence. The goaltending has been shaky. The structure has been transient. Now this, prompting the enforced departure of one among final season’s most necessary property.

The Rangers want a pacesetter. They want a captain.

Calling Kid Okay.

Calling Chris Kreider."

Hopes of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation were dashed Monday as it was allocated only Rs 502 crore in the Union Budget for the fiscal 2021-22. With this, the civic body would be staring at another financial crisis this year. Interestingly, this amount has been allocated when the UT civic body has already passed a budget of Rs 1,627 crore.

The municipal corporation was expecting a grant in aid of over Rs 1,000 crore from the UT Administration and they got nearly half of it. However, the grant in aid to be received this year is slightly more than what it got last year, which is Rs 425 core.

The municipal corporation’s own committed liabilities form around Rs 500 crore a year. Committed liabilities include expenses like electricity, water, salaries and pension of employees — expenditure which they cannot ignore. Remaining, if any, would be spent on development works of the city. Municipal corporation handles roads of the city, water supply, waste disposal, sewerage and other civic works.

In the budget passed by it, for building and roads, the civic body has allocated around Rs 80 crore while Rs 55 crore has been allocated for augmentation of water supply. Moreover, Rs 23.60 crore has been allocated for ward development fund and Rs 47 crore has been kept for village development fund. Sewerage and civic works form around Rs 45 crore.

Municipal corporation's own expected revenue is really less as compared to the budget it has prepared. From petrol pumps, the MC aims to earn Rs 130 crore, while from property tax it expects to earn Rs 50 crore. From water tariff and sewerage cess, civic body aims to earn around Rs 150 crore while it is expecting around 130 crore from other receipts.

The finance and contract committee of Chandigarh Municipal Corporation in its meeting has already approved the budget estimates of Rs 443 crore under capital head and Rs 1,184 crore under the revenue head for the financial year 2021-22."
article_4052,"Aside from prioritising investments, adopting an expansionary fiscal stance and pegging in a sharp increase in capital expenditure in FY22, the Budget has rightly taken several bold moves to strengthen the financial sector to ensure sustainable growth in the economy.

As was widely expected, the Centre has finally laid down a roadmap for privatisation of public sector banks (two to start with). While this can improve credit growth, bring in better operational efficiencies, and address the growing recap issue, implementation will be critical.

The government – the majority shareholder – has been injecting capital into PSBs year after year. But further recapitalisation has become challenging. Various estimates indicate that PSBs will require about ?40,000-50,000 crore in FY22. Aside from the quantum of capital infusion, the other key issue lies in the government’s sizeable holdings, which impedes huge recapitalisation (over 90 per cent in few PSBs). Also, public sector bank boards are still not adequately professionalised, and the government still deciding on board appointments, has led to politicisation.

Privatisation of some PSBs can help address these issues. But it will be important to implement such a bold move in a planned manner. After all, it will be critical for the entity to have strong boards before it is privatised, lest the government selling down its stake may not find many takers. PSBs have been trading at 0.4-0.5 times book value for the past few years. But even such low valuations, haven’t kindled investor interest.

To push forth its wider set of objectives of state policy, the government can seek to retain full control of some large PSBs, and de-list them.

Finally, a bad bank

In a bid to ease banks’ capital and spur lending, the Budget has finally proposed the setting up of a bad bank. But will this help restore the health of the banking sector?

There are several issues that need attention while implementing such a proposal. For starters, assessing the amount of funding or capital that a bad bank requires will be critical as will be the mode of constant funding. In India, there are already 29 asset reconstruction companies. But ARCs have not been able to make a meaningful impact owing to multiple headwinds. One critical issue has been capital. ARC is a capital intensive business. While there are 29 ARCs, the top three ARCs constitute over 70 per cent of the industry. Owing to judicial delays in the recovery process, drawing investors has been difficult.

Also, steady recapitalisation of originating banks (selling bad loans to the bad bank) will also be imperative, as asset transfer is likely to occur at a price below the book value. How will the government raise resources to meet the overall funding requirement?

The next critical issue to be addressed will be pricing. Arriving at a consensus on pricing has been a key issue with banks and ARCs, more so because of the lack of a distressed asset market in India. In case of a bad bank a transparent and robust pricing mechanism will be all the more critical. Also, the bad bank will need institutional independence, ring-fencing it from political intervention.

Addressing all these issues will be critical for the bad bank to serve its intended purpose.

Insurance is an important route through which the Centre can raise stable long-term money. Hence, increasing the FDI limit in insurance to 74 per cent from 49 per cent can help bring in more capital into the sector. However, will raising the FDI limit alone draw foreign investors into the sector? Not necessarily, if past trends are any indication.

Also, the rationalisation of taxation of ULIPs, could impact some players which have a heavy ULIP portfolio and a higher ticket size.

The government had increased the FDI limit in insurance in 2015 to 49 per cent from 26 per cent. But five years after the limit was raised, only 8 life insurance players out of 23 private players, and 4 out of the 21 private general insurers have foreign promoter holdings of 49 per cent. Many insurance players still have foreign holdings of 26 per cent or even lower, according to data available for September 2020. Indian promoters still hold 100 per cent stake in companies such as Exide Life, Kotak Mahindra Life and Reliance General.

But given the broader picture across both life and general insurance players, it appears that raising the FDI limit alone may not assure easy access to capital. Also, while the mandate that the majority of directors on the board should be resident Indians is welcome, whether there will be any cap on voting rights of foreign shareholders needs to be seen.

In what could hurt the top line growth of few life insurance players, the Budget has sought to remove the tax exemption currently available on maturity proceeds of ULIPs (above annual premium of ?2.5 lakh). This can hurt the growth of few life insurance players that have a heavy ULIP portfolio. Of the listed players, ICICI Pru Life and SBI Life have a relatively higher ULIP proportion in their product mix (48-62 per cent of annualised premium equivalent). HDFC Life will see minimal impact of the move. Also, its average ticket size is about ?60,000 on ULIPs. For ICICI Pru Life the average ticket size on ULIPs is slightly higher at ?1.8 lakh (as of FY20), and it could see some impact on its growth. However, the impact on profitability will be lower as ULIPs are lower margin business than protection products for life insurers."

Annual Report and Balace Sheet 2020 BBS-BIOACTIVE BONE SUBSTITUTES Plc (English version, unaudited) ANNUAL REPORT 1 JANUARY - 31 DECEMBER 2020 Business Review BBS-Bioactive Bone Substitutes Plc (“BBS”, “the Company”) is a biomedical technology Company that develops, manufactures and commercialises innovative, bioactive medical devices and implants for orthopedic surgery. The Company’s administration and quality control laboratory are in Oulu and production facility in Reisjärvi. The Company has been listed on Nasdaq First North Growth Market marketplaces operated by Helsinki Ltd (BONEH) in Finland and Nasdaq Stockholm in Sweden (BONES). In early 2020 the Company actions focused on quality system and technical file preparations, process validations as well as finalising the clinical study report. The Company is close to ending of its product development and is approaching its first product launch to the markets. The Company collected new equity from markets to secure the finalisation of its product development and approval of its first commercial product. To ensure its short-term liquidity the Company decided to take out a working capital loan of EUR 200 thousand in March from Finha Capital Oy, which is one of the Company’s main owners. In June 2020 The Company carried out a share issue in the Nasdaq First North GM marketplace in Helsinki and Stockholm. The issue raised new funds of EUR 5.47 million for the Company. The previously mentioned working capital loan was converted into the Company’s shares in connection with the Rights Issue. The Company released an announcement in February 2020 about the results of the clinical trial that showed ARTEBONE® Paste to function as well as human autograft in fusion of ankle. First interim results of the animal trial requested by regulatory authorities were announced on August 31st, 2020. Based on the results, it was concluded that the final report is likely to fulfil the requirements set by the regulatory authorities. Due to inconsistent interpretations of study samples by the study facility an amendment on analytical method was made to study protocol and the measurements were partly repeated. Management of the Company has estimated that the Company will receive the CE marking for the ARTEBONE® product designed to heal bone fractures and damages during 2021. The schedule described above requires that Notified Body in Europe can process the Company’s CE marking application within eight months of the submission of the application. The Notified Body does not commit to precise application processing times, which means that the Company can only assess the schedule when the CE marking was granted. The Company objective was earlier to submit the CE marking application to Notified Body in autumn 2020. Then the Company could have received the CE marking in spring 2021. However, in autumn 2020 significant causes of delays were observed. The US market approval submission to FDA has not advanced significantly during the financial period. Company aims to submit the application to FDA after its application for CE-marking has been submitted. At a general level, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused delays and made the operating environment more difficult. During autumn, the ongoing commissioning of new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in Europe has highlighted significant number of unfinished documents, quality tests and qualifications of production equipment in the Company. In addition, the Notified Body demands that all documents must be ready for submission at the same time with the CE marking application, whereas according to previous practice, the application could be supplemented during the application process. Furthermore, the further measurements of the animal experiment required by the authority have had to wait longer than expected as the company released in August 2020. The Company took several corrective actions during end of 2020 to correct the deficiencies due to the above reasons. FINANCIAL REVIEW Operating result BBS Plc had no revenue during the financial year 2020, nor in the corresponding period of the previous year.

Last options were allocated to the key personnel in 2013. Each option entitles its holder to subscribe for one share at the price of one euro., On January 9th, 2018 the Board of Directors extended the subscription period until December 31st, 2023. As the number of new shares in the option program is limited to 170 000 representing only three percent (3%) of the total, this has no perceptible impact on the earnings or other key figures per share Valid Authorisations by AGM The Annual General Meeting authorised the Board of Directors on the issuance of up to 1 000 000 (one million) new shares. The total number of authorisations represent to approximately 15% of the company's share capital, The share issue may be carried out by increasing the share capital by a new subscription or by taking out convertible bonds in one or more tranches.

Risks and uncertainties Significant risks and uncertainties independent of the Company are identified both in the area of the product development and the commercialising activities. Risks can lead to further postponement, as the authorities have the right to require complements and alterations to the documentation presented. The risk in the product classification lies in the interpretation of the authorities. The decision will be based on the results of the animal testing, which are expected to be available shortly. The FDA registration process has been started. The matters causing delays in the CE application process may also reflect the FDA registration. In the US, there is a fundamental risk in the 510 (k) approval route that allows the use of precedents. But according to the company's current knowledge, no difficulties are expected in these areas. Operational risks include, among other things, the dependence on the skills of the key personnel and the measures to strengthen their commitment. On the financial side, the uncertainty in the stock market caused by the Covid19 pandemic is considered a risk. However, as a medical device development and manufacturing company, BBS is more of a long-term investment. The initial R&D phase takes a long time, followed by four to five years of post-launch marketing and growth of sales. Once sales have become profitable, the growth phase with the same product potentially continues for a long period of time.

article_4058,"More firms are set to learn from a lighter compliance burden because the finance minister has proposed to revise the definition of a small firm below India’s company legal guidelines.

Also, corporations will discover it simpler to resolve their debt, and the mergers and acquisitions area will seemingly see elevated exercise, as Nirmala Sitharaman stated the federal government would introduce various strategies of debt decision together with a particular framework for micro, small and medium enterprises, together with measures to strengthen the National Company Law Tribunals.

While the minister didn’t present particulars of the choice strategies, the company affairs ministry had final month proposed a framework for pre-packaged insolvency decision, which is predicted to fast-track the method by out-of-court negotiations that may require a courtroom approval solely on the finish.

As per the brand new definition, an organisation with a paid-up capital of as much as Rs 2 crore and turnover of as much as Rs 20 crore will qualify as a small firm, versus the present thresholds of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 10 crore. This change is predicted to learn some 200,000 firms.

With a concentrate on ease of doing enterprise, the federal government would take up decriminalisation of compoundable offences below the Limited Liability Partnership Act, Sitharaman stated. It has already completed this for the Companies Act.

The minister additionally introduced adjustments to the principles governing one-person firms (OPCs).



Under the prevailing guidelines, such firms with a paid-up capital of over Rs 50 lakh or turnover exceeding Rs 2 crore should convert to a standard firm. The finances has proposed to put off these limits altogether, together with eradicating the restriction on non-resident Indians from incorporating such firms, a transfer which Sitharaman stated was anticipated to learn startups.

While this may occasionally allow one-person firms to scale up and luxuriate in easier statutory compliances, the adjustments are unlikely to learn startups a lot, stated Ankit Singhi, accomplice at Corporate Professionals. “Startups need to raise funds by increasing the number of board members but OPCs cannot have more than one person on the board,” Singhi stated.

According to Nischal Arora, accomplice at Nangia & Co, the transfer will encourage small unorganised sector gamers to conduct their companies by a legally arrange entity.

The proposed adjustments to OPCs and the definition of small firms would require adjustments solely to firm guidelines and never an modification to the legislation, Singhi stated.

“The Companies Act prescribes a maximum paid up capital threshold of Rs 10 crore and a maximum turnover threshold of Rs 100 crore for small companies. The changed definition falls within this range and will not require changes to the law,” he stated.

Summer trips across the pond were a post-war tradition, with hordes of Americans making the annual pilgrimage to Europe. Britain, a seven-hour flight from the East Coast, was often the first (or only) stopover.

The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated transatlantic travel in 2020 with quarantines, travel restrictions and airline closures, as well as, let’s face it, customer disgust for the plane. But JetBlue is announcing an upcoming service from the United States to London, which could challenge the fun factor. A key part of JetBlue’s plan is to bring its popular TBEN offering to transatlantic flights, making premium travel “less stuffy and more affordable,” according to Joanna Geraghty, president and chief operating officer of JetBlue.

Ms Geraghty told us, “London is the biggest underserved market outside of New York and Boston – we think we can disrupt with a much better product.” A key part of this product offering is their premium seat, which JetBlue calls the TBEN experience. The Boston Globe in 2018 called the US version of TBEN the airline’s business-class version with “first-class amenities at a bargain price of $ 599.”

(Full disclosure: I own shares in Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and JetBlue.)

JetBlue says service to London (airport TBD) from New York or Boston will begin in the third quarter, between July 1 and September 30. JetBlue will not be more specific on when the service begins, when tickets go on sale, or how they will be priced.

JetBlue’s new Airbus A321LR, a long-range single-aisle jet, will operate transatlantic flights. Two classes of service will be offered, the luxurious TBEN Experience and JetBlue’s Core seats, or coach class. JetBlue says TBEN seats are suites. The A321LR will feature 24 private suites with a sliding door for each guest and a custom designed seat cushion by Tuft & Needle.

JetBlue is the first carrier to equip its aircraft with the Thompson Aero VantageSolo seat, which includes a 17-inch seat screen, power in the seat and plenty of storage. As Thompson says, “From a seat pitch of just 33 inches, the VantageSolo offers a fully horizontal flat bed with direct aisle access for each seat. TBEN seats “Are all very private and self-contained, and each suite has a window,” says Jayne O’Brien, Head of Brand and Loyalty at JetBlue.

If that’s not enough luxury or privacy, passengers can book a TBEN Studio. Each plane will have two TBEN studios in the front row, a feat. JetBlue boasts that TBEN Studio has the largest flatbed of any US carrier, plus a 22-inch reclining back screen and a side table with a guest seat. O’Brien adds, “You can even invite a guest to share a table.”

Premium reclining seats have been a crucial source of revenue for airlines. Geraghty says, “A lot of customers want this type of product but don’t want to pay $ 5,000 for their seat at the published rates. We impose a level of pricing discipline; TBEN was as low as $ 499 when we launched transcontinental service in 2014. ”

Does Geraghty feel some trepidation due to the fluctuations in the stock market and the continuing pandemic? Geraghty said, “We don’t. There will be light at the end of the tunnel with the increasing use of vaccines. This has been a painful year, but things are opening up and this service is an exciting opportunity for JetBlue. “

Could the service be postponed due to COVID-19 issues, such as quarantines, test questions, or vaccine availability? “We don’t know what we don’t know about travel restrictions or international testing,” Geraghty says, “we hope there will be a more cohesive framework.”

Geraghty describes the aircraft to be used, the new Airbus A321LR, as “very flexible”. The single-aisle jet offers a range of 4,000 miles while being economical to operate. Equally important, with around 180 seats, it should be easy to fill with passengers, especially compared to large jets like the 500-seat Airbus A380 or the popular 248-seat Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Norwegian Airlines, which recently withdrew from US service due to financial problems, operated 37 Dreamliners. Could the departure of Norwegian, which as recently as 2020 was the largest foreign carrier operating outside the New York area, carrying over 2 million passengers, help JetBlue’s European bid?

Geraghty declined to comment on the Norwegian. Instead, she cited JetBue’s significant presence on the East Coast, “a wonderful premium product and a solid core (coach) product, and partnerships with other airlines.”

And while Geraghty is confident the new service will be successful, she says as she tries out the “three-plane” service, the risk is limited. “If the service to London isn’t working, we can point to the west coast of the United States.”

Certainly, COVID-19 quarantines and restrictions could prove to be a wild card. Already, all travelers entering the United States must provide proof of a negative COVID test. In summer, travelers may be required to provide proof of vaccination to fly.

But with millions of Americans keen to escape a year of lockdown, the time may have come for JetBlue to dip its toes into the trip across the pond."
article_4060,"Wall Street's main indexes were set for a higher open on Monday following a steep sell-off last week, as a shift in the retail trading frenzy to silver drove up mining stocks and investors awaited manufacturing data later in the day. The iShares Silver Trust ETF jumped 9.6% in premarket trading as silver broke above $30 an ounce for the first time since 2013 with an army of retail traders storming into the metal after betting billions of dollars on stocks last week.

Silver miners Hecla Mining Co, Coeur Mining Inc and Wheaton Precious Metals Corp surged between 14% and 32%. ""It's just a relief rally after the sharp decline on Friday,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

Wall Street's main indexes last week logged their steepest weekly fall since October, as investors digested efficacy data from Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine trial results, while a slugfest between Wall Street hedge funds and retail investors added to the volatility. The CBOE volatility index eased on Monday from three-month highs that were fueled by a surge in shares of GameStop Corp, AMC Entertainment Holdings and others that burnt hedge funds who had bet against the companies. GameStop was down about 1%, while AMC jumped another 25%.

The wild swings in the so-called ""meme"" stocks dominated the news on Wall Street last week, even as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and other corporate heavyweights reported quarterly results. ""The sentiment right now is precarious. The market has already discounted a good earnings season and rebound in economic growth based on the vaccination,"" Cardillo said.

Of the 184 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings, 84.2% have topped analyst expectations, well above the 75.5% beat rate for the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv data as of Friday. Focus now turns towards quarterly earnings from Amazon.com Inc and Google-owner Alphabet Inc on Tuesday to wrap up results from the so-called FAANG group.

Meanwhile, market participants also monitored stimulus talks. Ten moderate Republican U.S. senators urged President Joe Biden on Sunday to significantly downsize his sweeping $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package to win bipartisan support. At 08:26 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 216 points, or 0.72% and S&P 500 E-minis were up 33.75 points, or 0.91%. Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 135 points, or 1.05%.

On the data front, ISM's survey at 10 a.m. ET is expected to show factory activity ticked lower in January after approaching a near two-and-a-half year high in December. Electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc gained about 3% as Piper Sandler raised its price target to the highest among the brokerages covering the stock.

Filed away in my vast catalogue of Deep Dark Fears, subfolder Internet-Related, is the dread of discovering myself as the antagonist in an advice column letter.

During one especially rough period in a years-ago job, I had to stop reading Alison Green’s excellent work advice column Ask A Manager. I was irrationally anxious that I’d come across the untenable situation I was in, neatly recounted so that Green could rule against me. The mere sight of a “34F” (my current age and gender, not my bra size) in a Reddit advice post often gives me a momentary flash of alarm before I read on and confirm that no, I am probably not the writer’s soon-to-be sister-in-law who’s demanding that her pet ferrets replace the groom’s nephew as ring-bearer.

I’ve been an online advice addict for years. Procrastinating on prepaid internet in my university library in the mid-00s, I trawled through years of archived Dear Prudence and Since You Asked columns on Slate and Salon, respectively, then Savage Love and Heather Havrilesky’s Dear Rabbit. I read Havrilesky on The Awl as Ask Polly and then followed various members of the Awl/Hairpin/Toast Extended Content Universe to later advice-dispensaries at bigger sites. (I never went through a big Dear Sugar phase, somehow.) And now, of course, there's a glorious array of internet sages, from ¡Hola Papi! to the crowdsourced, democratized blob of solicited advice in the queasily addictive annals of advice subreddits, from r/AITA to r/relationships.

I have relished the gossipy thrills of reading about people’s awful mothers-in-law (so many!), and gulped down tough and tender counsel for more existential dilemmas as I wrestled with my own. I studied the carefully worded scripts some agony aunts and uncles offered for delicate situations — as a neurodivergent person who's not always great with social cues and emotional perspective, I found these perspectives were useful ways to build empathy and a better picture of what's ""right"" in a range of situations. And a few years ago, I wept over hundreds of almost identical posts and letters from people wondering if they were “allowed” to break up with a good person whom they loved in order to give them both a better chance at happiness. (They are, and so was I.)

It’s addictive, and it’s certainly worth remembering that, as Slate’s current Dear Prudence writer Daniel Lavery cautions me, “advice columns are about entertainment, not just moral instruction.” But as the overflowing inboxes of any prominent advice columnist prove, there’s never any shortage of people clamouring for both.

“People write to advice columns for all kinds of reasons but probably a big overarching reason is the desire to narrativize a problem they're having,” explains Emily Gould, a novelist and a recent-ish addition to Slate’s parenting advice column Care And Feeding . “‘Asking for advice’ is a form. Within that form, you can tell a story.”

Jennifer Peepas, aka advice blogger Captain Awkward , started saving advice columns while she was in grad school studying film because they ""were great source material for screenplays and other fiction.""

“You've got characters, you've got conflict, you've got a distinct point of view in terms of who is asking the question and how reliable a narrator they are,"" she says.

I wonder when we will collectively admit that the dominant short fiction forms of the 2020s are r/AITA posts and online advice column letters — Emily Gould (@EmilyGould) September 16, 2020

Even when we’re not actively wrestling with a specific thorny problem of our own, it’s natural to look for ourselves in other people’s stories, to seek out the characters we identify with and pick a side, because stories are — say it with me — how we help make sense of ourselves and others.

But whether or not we are literally the nightmare coworker or clueless bridesmaid, what do we actually get out of devouring these dilemmas? Can they actually teach us, as Havrilesky’s collection of advice letters and answers promises, how to be a person in the world ?

It still counts as reaching out

Slate sex advice columnist Stoya, who began doling out expertise “on Tumblr in the 2010s” armed with her experience in adult entertainment, says simply that advice columns are “a great way to learn.”

“I came of age reading Dan Savage,” she tells me in an email. “His column ran in a local Philadelphia weekly paper, and it tackled so much of the reality of communicating about sex, which I wasn't able to find books covering at the time. He's obviously critiqueable, but I learned a lot from him about moving on when something isn't a match, which I think has served me well and comes up in my own work for Slate.”

And there’s a more fundamental benefit to being in the audience for these shared problems: They connect you to the people sharing them. Yes, you get to peek into their lives, anonymously and consensually and safely, but they’re also putting a little something of themselves into yours.

“I certainly have loved reading [advice columns] because I enjoy — and these are a series of sometimes-contradictory impulses that coexist perfectly peacefully together — how reading about other people's problems can simultaneously make me feel safer, smugger, smarter, less alone, vindicated, implicated, challenged, inspired,” writer Lavery of Dear Prudence tells me. “I suspect plenty of other readers share those reactions, although I can't speak for everyone. It's not merely rubbernecking, I suppose is what I mean to say.”

“I think the online world has played a big role in normalizing mental health support and just discussions around mental health in general.”

“Even if you’re just reading [online advice] and not taking part in any discussion, it can fulfill that desire for social connection that we all have, even if it's a passive one,” says Dr. Brad Ridout, deputy chair of the Cyberpsychology Research Group at the University of Sydney (the same institution where I ignored assignments to binge-read Dear Polly). Ridout, who has a doctorate in psychology, is currently focused on developing a social network with Australian youth counselling service Kids Helpline where young people can access anonymous, text-based support from qualified counsellors.

“Social media, in general, not just online advice, has played a huge role in normalizing help-seeking behavior, especially when people can do it anonymously,” Ridout says. “I think the online world has played a big role in normalizing mental health support and just discussions around mental health in general.”

Help getting help

Sure, some people will literally write to an advice columnist (or put an amusing or chilling novella on Reddit) instead of going to therapy . And to be clear, there are so, so many situations that a few hundred words of advice from a nice middle-class white lady (as so many of the most beloved advice columnists are) can’t hope to resolve. From debilitating mental health or financial issues, to abusive relationships and serious legal liability — columnists’ inboxes are stuffed with horror stories alongside lighter etiquette questions.

“I've become an accidental expert at identifying abusive dynamics in all kinds of relationships, which means a ton of people write to me about their abusive relationships, easily 100 [times] the number of letters about it that appear on the site, and I spend a lot of time just hoping and wishing and praying that the people can get away safely and that nothing I said will make it worse,” says Peepas of Captain Awkward. “Some of them write to me years afterward to tell me they are safe, and I cherish those, because most times I'll never know.” (She also has a category of emails called Above The Captain’s Paygrade, for letter writers whose troubles are more systemic than personal: “Fully half my inbox could be solved with affordable housing policies and sufficient food aid, so nobody has to live with the worst people they know in order to survive. This is not an exaggeration.”)

For those heavier problems, while a columnist (or comment section) may have kind, blunt, and useful advice about how to cope, a responsible pro will recommend consulting a qualified professional for further support in the longterm, whether that means couples counseling, individual therapy, or formal legal advice.

“We're bombarded with images of people, you know, having everything together and an antidote to that is showing us that not everyone does have everything together, and it's OK to discuss the more ugly parts of life.”

These resources are not accessible to everyone (though they should be) and ""get therapy"" is not the answer to all problems either. But reiterating this message wherever appropriate feeds back into the normalising of seeking that support, and not just for the letter writers. As Ridout notes, “It can be a lot easier to take advice if it's directed to another person.”

What’s more, he says, reading the warts-and-all anonymous letters and posts can act as a counterweight to the shinier, curated versions of life we see people post under their own names. “We're bombarded with images of people, you know, having everything together and an antidote to that is showing us that not everyone does have everything together, and it's OK to discuss the more ugly parts of life,” he says.

How to be your own agony aunt

I asked the columnists what they’d say to me and my fellow advice addicts, constantly lurking in the internet’s fretful corners, in search of that soothing rhythm of dilemma and solution, or possibly an answer to a question we haven’t asked yet. More than one advised that we try to DIY.

“I think most of these people are writers, whether they understand themselves to be writers or not, and they might enjoy doing an exercise that I long to assign to writing students: Write a short story in the form of an advice column, with a question and an answer,” says Gould.ma

Peepas says the advice-column letter form is so powerful, it can sometimes be part of the solution without the columnist ever throwing in their two cents. “Some of the best ‘fan mail’ I get is someone saying ‘I wrote you a whole long letter, and then I realized what I needed to do and did it, thank you!’” she says. “Yes! You told your story and it showed you how it needed to end. Good job.”

“You can imagine someone is asking you about the situation,” suggests Stoya, ""or you can imagine that you're commissioning your favorite advice writer to tackle this person's question and imagine what they might say.""

Gould agrees.

“There's a lot of sameness to the texture of many people's lives right now — sameness alternating with badness,” Gould says. “I like to imagine that the ‘learn how to tell your own story’ aspect of it is helpful to other people. Sometimes, it is helpful to me.

“Just getting it down on the page can be enormously helpful. No matter how — or indeed whether — somebody answers you.”

article_4062,"Silver broke above US $ 30 an ounce for the first time since 2013 on Monday as an army of retail traders broke into the metal after betting billions of dollars in stocks last week.

Organized in online forums and traded with free brokers such as Robinhood, small investors led a 1,600% rally in the shares of video game retailer GameStop, recovering the assets that the big fund managers had bet against.

The phenomenon spilled over into silver late last week.

Spot silver jumped more than 11 percent in London to $ 30.03 an ounce and was on track for its biggest one-day rise since 2008, taking gains to around 19 percent since Wednesday latest.

The jump sparked a rally in silver mining stocks from Sydney to London.

The silver action, following thousands of Reddit posts and hundreds of YouTube videos, suggests that a physical price hike could hurt large investors with bearish bets, also marks a foray into a much larger market and more liquid than individual stocks.

ALSO READ How 3 Canadians Fight Anti-Black Racism in Education | TBEN News On Twitter, #silversqueeze was all the rage as investors turned to money, but some members of the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit insist it’s not their latest strategy. (Dado Ruvic / Reuters)

“I would look at the money rally the same way as the GameStop saga – from a market stability standpoint, at this point it’s not an immediate concern, but if we see any sharp moves, we could see some deleveraging in the markets, ”said Antoine Bouvet, pricing strategist at ING.

“This reduction in risk through deleveraging could potentially stimulate demand for bonds if it results in excessive volatility.”

In the first signs of deleveraging, Goldman Sachs said the amount of position hedging last week by US hedge funds, buying and selling, was the highest since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.

However, their stock market exposure to equities remains close to record levels, the investment bank warned.

Rise of new trading platforms

The rush for money and GameStop-style stocks has tested the limits of new trading platforms and processing sites, frustrating retail traders who are unable to feed their hunger to buy and sell. sell more frequently.

The feverish buying of silver has run into a problem, with large US broker Apmex warning of processing delays as it secures more bullion. The online exchange Money Metals has suspended trading until mid-morning Monday.

The volume of trading in small miner stocks in Australia was unprecedented, and jumps in some exploration companies, which do not actually produce money, have exceeded 90 percent.

Similar hiccups were seen in stocks over the past week. GameStop, AMC, and a few other volatile stocks have seen temporary buying restrictions in trading apps like Robinhood as frenzied buying has led trading apps to put on the brakes.

“The Reddit crowd has turned to a bigger whale in trying to catalyze something with short squeeze in the silver market,” said Kyle Rodda, analyst at IG Markets brokerage in Melbourne.

“It’s their big and daring Moby Dick moment.”

Silver the last ‘short squeeze’

The popularity of dabbling in the stock markets has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as volatility, stimulus checks and lockdowns have resulted in account openings and investments.

The craze peaked last week when the GameStop stacking resulted in a ‘short squeeze,’ transforming price gains stratospheric as hedge funds with stock bets desperately bought it off at stocks. high prices to close their positions.

Now it’s the turn of the money and, once again, the scale of the purchases surprises professionals.

Online discussions turned to silver late last week, as Reddit posts suggested that higher prices could hurt banks with large short positions, and that buying traded silver funds easily accessible stock exchanges could quickly increase the value of the metal.

Retail traders poured a record C $ 39.1 million into Australian ETF Securities’ Physical Silver fund in the afternoon. A silver ETF in Japan jumped 11 percent.

All eyes are on possible gains later today in iShares’s US-listed $ 16.5 billion Silver Trust ETF, which rose 5.6% last week.

“We see little chance of a tightening in the silver market,” Commerzbank’s Eugen Weinberg said. “After all, the market is not only large and difficult to manipulate; unlike stocks, there is no excessive short selling with money.”

So far, Redditors continue. Many of the renegade traders are paper millionaires and their hedge fund opponents are healing their wounds. Melvin Capital, which bet against GameStop, lost 53% of its portfolio in January.

Robinhood, the main brokerage for Redditors, has also backed down and lifted some of the buying restrictions it imposed last week, although limits remain for eight companies, including GameStop, AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry.

However, with regulators circling both Robinhood and the Redditors forums, the battle is far from over.

“I’ll tell you one thing, [I] absolute guarantee that it ends in tears, “said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets (Australia).” I just don’t know when. ”

Annual Report and Balace Sheet 2020 BBS-BIOACTIVE BONE SUBSTITUTES Plc (English version, unaudited) ANNUAL REPORT 1 JANUARY - 31 DECEMBER 2020 Business Review BBS-Bioactive Bone Substitutes Plc (“BBS”, “the Company”) is a biomedical technology Company that develops, manufactures and commercialises innovative, bioactive medical devices and implants for orthopedic surgery. The Company’s administration and quality control laboratory are in Oulu and production facility in Reisjärvi. The Company has been listed on Nasdaq First North Growth Market marketplaces operated by Helsinki Ltd (BONEH) in Finland and Nasdaq Stockholm in Sweden (BONES). In early 2020 the Company actions focused on quality system and technical file preparations, process validations as well as finalising the clinical study report. The Company is close to ending of its product development and is approaching its first product launch to the markets. The Company collected new equity from markets to secure the finalisation of its product development and approval of its first commercial product. To ensure its short-term liquidity the Company decided to take out a working capital loan of EUR 200 thousand in March from Finha Capital Oy, which is one of the Company’s main owners. In June 2020 The Company carried out a share issue in the Nasdaq First North GM marketplace in Helsinki and Stockholm. The issue raised new funds of EUR 5.47 million for the Company. The previously mentioned working capital loan was converted into the Company’s shares in connection with the Rights Issue. The Company released an announcement in February 2020 about the results of the clinical trial that showed ARTEBONE® Paste to function as well as human autograft in fusion of ankle. First interim results of the animal trial requested by regulatory authorities were announced on August 31st, 2020. Based on the results, it was concluded that the final report is likely to fulfil the requirements set by the regulatory authorities. Due to inconsistent interpretations of study samples by the study facility an amendment on analytical method was made to study protocol and the measurements were partly repeated. Management of the Company has estimated that the Company will receive the CE marking for the ARTEBONE® product designed to heal bone fractures and damages during 2021. The schedule described above requires that Notified Body in Europe can process the Company’s CE marking application within eight months of the submission of the application. The Notified Body does not commit to precise application processing times, which means that the Company can only assess the schedule when the CE marking was granted. The Company objective was earlier to submit the CE marking application to Notified Body in autumn 2020. Then the Company could have received the CE marking in spring 2021. However, in autumn 2020 significant causes of delays were observed. The US market approval submission to FDA has not advanced significantly during the financial period. Company aims to submit the application to FDA after its application for CE-marking has been submitted. At a general level, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused delays and made the operating environment more difficult. During autumn, the ongoing commissioning of new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in Europe has highlighted significant number of unfinished documents, quality tests and qualifications of production equipment in the Company. In addition, the Notified Body demands that all documents must be ready for submission at the same time with the CE marking application, whereas according to previous practice, the application could be supplemented during the application process. Furthermore, the further measurements of the animal experiment required by the authority have had to wait longer than expected as the company released in August 2020. The Company took several corrective actions during end of 2020 to correct the deficiencies due to the above reasons. FINANCIAL REVIEW Operating result BBS Plc had no revenue during the financial year 2020, nor in the corresponding period of the previous year. The consolidated result for the review period was EUR -2,73 million (EUR -1,69 million in 2019) consisting of expenses for research and development, administration and finance. Investments and Financing The capital expenditure on machinery and equipment at Reisjärvi production site amounted to EUR 82 thousand (EUR 23 thousand in 2019). All the development expenses were recognised as costs in the Profit and Loss statement. The Company’s cash resources at December 31st 2020 were EUR 3,44 million (EUR 0,52 million in 2019) and increased by EUR 2,92 million during the period (EUR -1,17 million in 2019) Acquisitions and Share Issues There were no mergers or acquisitions during the financial year. However, between June 2nd and 18th a rights issue was organised both in the Finnish and Swedish market. The Company offered up to 1 301 205 new shares, representing approximately 25% of the company’s shares. A total of 1.059.634 shares were subscribed based on pre-emption rights and the remaining 241.571 shares were allocated in accordance with the terms of the placement. Gross assets worth EUR 5,47 million were raised. However shortly afterwards, it became apparent that the subscription and payment of 65 500 shares by an existing shareholder had not been registered properly on the June 24th allocation. On June 26th, the Board of Directors agreed on an additional private placement of 65.500 shares to the investor at the same price and equal terms as the original issue. Additional EUR 0,27 million was collected. In total the company received EUR 5,74 million worth gross assets.

According to the renewed agreements the repayments are scheduled between June 30th and 2020 and June 30th 2028.

article_4070,"The unending desire to provide quality care at an affordable cost and develop a model that benefits all the stakeholders in the healthcare spectrum – patient, provider, payer, and pharma – has posed a big challenge. The industry is eagerly looking for disruptive ideas to offer relief from the vicious operating cycle, the inability to provide desired care and, mounting costs. With that in mind and the switch to retail-ization for the healthcare industry, we would like to present the concept of Just in Time (healthcare) Contracts (JITC). In a nutshell, JITC is a proposed facility to establish a contractual obligation, i.e., healthcare insurance contracts between payers and providers for a given case and ascertained period.

With the evolution of technologies such as blockchain, AI, and advanced analytics and integration standards like FHIR, this will become the norm in the coming years. JITC will empower payers to have a greater understanding of the risks to be covered, providers to have greater clarity on reimbursements, and patients to have better knowledge of their obligations.

Forging a plan: JITC Implementation

The proposed model will help providers avoid the need to choose between avoiding financial risks and providing care. JITC can help deliver care with minimized risks by using advanced technologies. Key determinants of the contract will include:

Deployment of blockchain-based consortiums that leverage smart contracts.

Use of patient data in the contracts for establishing the care risks including financial risks.

Putting out the risk parameters, along with the current care needs, to payers and providers.

A contract will be drafted with the nearest provider or provider of choice and with payer(s) willing to underwrite the care risk at an affordable cost for the patient.

The contract will continue to serve as the vehicle till the complete financial and care transactions between all the parties are settled.

Ideally, with this setup, the provider should be paid for the service under the contract within two to three days, bringing down the AR period. Among many opportunities for payers, JITC will ensure retail-ization of health insurance and create a market for product innovation. It will also break the shackles of network rigidity and complex actuarial models to sculpt networks. Instead, these efforts will be directed towards providing better care to patients. JITC will also provide an opportunity to directly deal with individual members rather than depending on an institutional average to understand the care risk, which is the paradigm all the payers strive towards.

Data-driven risk assessment strategies

We believe JITC will become a reality only when all the stakeholders of the healthcare continuum can accurately understand the relevant risk of coverage sought under the contract. For this, the payers may assess the risk based on numerous factors including but not limited to:

Individual’s personal, social, and clinical profile

Individual’s preferred provider profile

Knowledge on the medical condition under coverage

Knowledge on treatment outcomes from the specific provider for the specific medical condition

Similarly, providers may assess the risk based on:

Individual’s profile

Outcomes of previous treatment

Reimbursement experience with specific payers

Undoubtedly, data – about individuals, conditions, providers, outcomes, etc. – is crucial for stakeholders to equip themselves with risk assessment capabilities. Wealth of data, effective organization of data, and advanced data analytics employing machine learning techniques will form the backbone of JITC. Here, data analytics will help in risk evaluation, contract pricing, best provider identification, exclusion assessment, and even enable contextualized, value-added services beyond JITC. For example, if the contract sought involves any hospitalization for post-operative/post-discharge care, individuals can be offered suggestions to connect with skilled nurses, laboratories, or caregivers that are already plugged onto the consortium network.

The future

We believe, just like Uber transformed transportation and Airbnb changed hospitality, JITC has the potential to drive a considerable shift within the healthcare segment. Uber Eats, that has created last-mile integration for many small restaurants that required logistics to reach end customers, is a good example. Currently, we are evaluating a single dimension of JITC, however we believe, it can drive wide change in the existing models of healthcare delivery.

Additionally, JITC has the potential to ensure right care for the right price at the right time and also open new avenues for care. The contract will make room for a variety of providers not backed by a large organizational umbrella to provide care, thus driving the industry into a disruptive transformation fueled by evolving digital technologies. In our opinion, sooner or later, JITC will be embraced as the norm for providing care."

This will also open up a new avenue for FPIs to invest in a growing market like India,"" Manoj Purohit, Partner and Leader - Financial Services Tax at BDO India said.In the context of the real estate sector, budget announcements relating to monetisation of infrastructure and real estate assets will help increase private sector participation and also assist government in enhancing fund flow for development of critical infrastructure assets, Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director of Knight Frank India said.The relaxation on tax compliance for REIT investors will further improve the marketability of such products considering we are likely to witness new REITs this year, he added.In order to provide ease of compliance, the finance minister has proposed to make dividend payments to REIT and InvIT exempt from Tax Deducted at Source ( TDS ).Further, as the amount of dividend income cannot be estimated correctly by the shareholders for paying advance tax, the minister proposed to provide that advance tax liability on dividend income would arise only after the declaration or payment of dividend.Also, for FPIs, it has been proposed to enable deduction of tax on dividend income at lower treaty rate.V Balasubramaniam, MD and CEO, India INX welcomed the budget announcement on allowing debt financing of REITs and InvITs by FPIs and is well poised to providing listing and trading of these products on the exchange with considerable ease of business and quicker time to market for issuers and tax efficient trading for foreign investors across time zones with 22 hours non-stop trading.""Further, the FM's announcement to exempt taxes on dividends on REITs and InvITs will make them attractive and lucrative for investor,"" he said.Sandeep Upadhyay, MD (Infrastructure Advisory) atsaid TDS exemption on dividend payments to InvITs and REITS will certainly entice more sovereign wealth funds to invest into the sector.The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) first issued the guidelines for REITs and InvITs in 2014, and revised them in 2016 and 2017.Ever since Sebi introduced InvITs, markets witnessed the listing of two public InvITs - IRB InvIT Fund and India Grid Trust.

article_4072,"UK marks first COVID vaccine milestone with care home protection

The UK government on Monday said it has hit a crucial milestone” in its COVID-19 vaccination program, with figures indicating that residents at every eligible care home with older residents across England now administered a life-saving jab.

The National Health Service (NHS) said nurses, general practitioners (GPs) and other NHS staff have offered the life-saving jab to people living at more than 10,000 care homes with older residents, with only a small remainder have had their visits deferred by local directors of public health for safety reasons during a local outbreak. Those homes will be visited and jabbed as soon as NHS staff are allowed to do so.

Today marks a crucial milestone in our ongoing race to vaccinate the most vulnerable against this deadly disease. We said we would prioritise and protect care home residents, and that is exactly what we have done, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

There will be difficult moments to come, and the number of cases and people in hospital remains dangerously high. But vaccines are our route out of the pandemic, and having protected 8.9 million people with a first dose so far, our rollout programme will only accelerate from here on, he said.

Ian Turner, Executive Chair of the Registered Nursing Home Association, quoted Mahatma Gandhi in reference to the major rollout drive to protect the elderly from the deadly virus.

As Mahatma Gandhi said the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable’, and the pandemic has brought that quotation to the fore,” he said.

The NHS said that vaccination staff are now returning to homes that have been covered to jab any resident who was unable to have it during the previous visit because they had recently had COVID-19 or for other clinical reasons.

It has been a privilege to vaccinate some of the most vulnerable people and the wonderful people who look after them. Many have had little contact with the outside world throughout the pandemic and so it has been truly humbling for all, giving them hope and importantly protection against the disease, said Dr Nikki Kanani, a practising GP and NHS England’s primary care director.

“I would urge anyone who is offered the vaccine to come forward,” she said.

The UK’s Joint Committee of Vaccinations and Immunisations (JCVI), which set the priority groups for the COVID-19 vaccines, made older adult care home residents and their staff high priority groups due to being at particular risk from COVID-19 because of their age and frailty.

NHS England offered GPs up to GBP 30 extra to vaccinate care home residents in January to cover the increased time and logistics required in bringing the vaccine to care homes.

Our priority has been to protect care home residents throughout this pandemic, and I’m delighted we have reached this monumental milestone to protect the most at risk, said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

We cannot be complacent, and it is absolutely imperative everyone continues to play their part by staying home and protecting the NHS while the rollout continues, he warned.

According to the NHS, which is conducting the biggest programme of its kind in its history, vaccinations are now being administered at more than 250 hospitals, over 1,000 GP-led services, 117 high street pharmacies and 47 large-scale vaccination centres across the country with more coming online over the coming days and weeks.

With over 2 million more people vaccinated in communities across England this past week, the NHS’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign is off to a flying start with nearly nine out of ten people aged 80 and above, and over three quarters of people aged 75 and over, now having had their first jab,” said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive.

UK Care Minister Helen Whately said the government is working “on what we can do to try and enable visiting to restart” in care homes to enable families to be reunited.

The NHS is currently administering the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs, with three other jabs by Moderna, Novavax and Janssen also expected to come into the system in the coming months. For care homes, it has largely been the Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs being delivered due to the logistics of easier mobility and storage requirements.

The UK government has set a target to vaccinate care home residents and carers, people over 70 and frontline care workers by February 15.

Meanwhile, a further 587 virus-related deaths were reported on Sunday, which takes the UK’s COVID-19 death toll to 106,158 as the country remains under a strict ‘stay-at-home’ lockdown to keep control over a very high infection rate."
article_4073,"New Delhi, Feb 1 (IANS) Twitter on Monday suspended several accounts of high-profile celebrities and organisations, including actor Sushant Singh, Caravan magazine, Kisan Ekta Morcha, Tractor2twitr and several other politicians, farmer leaders, writers and activists, at the behest of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for spreading misinformation during the farmers’ protests.

The IT ministry and law enforcement agencies had last week ordered Twitter to block these tweets and accounts under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act.

A Twitter spokesperson said that many countries have laws that may apply to Tweets and/or Twitter account content.

“In our continuing effort to make our services available to people everywhere, if we receive a properly scoped request from an authorised entity, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time,” the micro-blogging platform said in a statement.

Transparency is vital to protecting freedom of expression, so we have a notice policy for withheld content. Upon receipt of requests to withhold content, we will promptly notify the affected account holders (unless we are prohibited from doing so e.g. if we receive a court order under seal),” the company informed.

Twitter last week said it suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation as the farmers’ tractor rally went violent in the national capital on the 72nd Republic Day.

The farmers swarmed the Red Fort and waved farmer union flags from its ramparts. They even hoisted farmer union flags as well as a pennant with a Sikh religious symbol from a flagpole.

A Twitter spokesperson told IANS that the company has taken strong enforcement action to protect the conversation on the service from attempts to incite violence, abuse and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm by blocking certain terms that violate our rules for trends.

“Using a combination of technology and human review, Twitter worked at scale and took action on hundreds of Tweets that have been in violation of the Twitter Rules and suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation,” the spokesperson informed.

The Delhi Police had warned that 308 Twitter handles have been generated to create confusion over the tractor rally proposed by protesting farmers on Republic Day.

Tahini is a Middle Eastern preparation that is quite nutritious and can be integrated in a number of food items. The tahini market has shown healthy growth in recent years, as Middle Eastern preparations and delicacies have attained greater popularity around the globe.

The global tahini market size is anticipated to reach USD 1.77 billion by the year 2025, advancing at a CAGR of 5.2% over the forecast period, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Tahini is a condiment originating from the Middle East that is prepared from toasted ground hulled sesame, and is popular in Levant and Eastern Mediterranean cuisines, as well as those of the South Caucasus. The condiment also has fair popularity in North African and East Asian cuisines. The rising popularity of tahini products with ethnic Arabic flavors in developed countries, such as the U.S., Germany, U.K., France, and Italy, is expected to aid the market growth. Additionally, increasing awareness about consuming healthy, nutritious, and organic food has propelled the product demand.

Changing dietary preferences owing to hectic lifestyle has fueled the demand for dips and sauces, with a large proportion of the working population moving towards exotic flavors and ingredients as a result of globalization. Moreover, tahini dips and sauces add flavor as well as nutrition to food products, which is expected to amplify market demand. Middle Eastern delicacies such as hummus, falafel pitas, and baba ghanoush have also seen their popularity soar, which is expected to positively develop the industry. Manufacturers are launching innovative products to cater to the increasing demand from the global food industry. Sesame seed-based tahini has captured attention in the market as it offers a number of health benefits such as skin detoxification and prevention of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), as well as the premature graying of hair.

The tahini market is broadly segmented on the basis of product and distribution channel. The major product segments where tahini is integrated include pasta and spreads, halva and other sweets, and sauces and dips. Major distribution channels for the product include online and offline. Over the past few years, major companies in the region are adopting several marketing strategies, such as product launches, product portfolio and distribution channel expansion, and merger and acquisition, to cater to the rising demand for vegan, gluten-free, non-GMO, Kosher products. Some of the notable industry players include Al Wadi Al Akhdar, El Rashidi El Mizan, Prince Tahina Ltd., Haitoglou Bros, Halwani Bros. Co., Ltd., Marwari International Pty. Ltd., Dipasa USA Inc., Kevala, Mounir Bissat Factories, and SESAJAL S.A. de C.V.

Tahini Market Report Highlights

1 Tahini has a wide scope of application in numerous products that include confectioneries, bakeries, sauces, dips, and salad dressings, which is the major factor driving market growth

2 The product is available in a wide range that includes vegan, gluten-free, non-GMO, Kosher, with zero artificial preservatives, which have increased the product attractiveness for consumers

3 Tahini is cholesterol-free, low-sodium, and has low saturated fat, and helps in lowering bad cholesterol, thus helping to reduce the risk of heart disease

5 North America is projected to be the fastest-growing regional market at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2019 to 2025, on account of the rising demand for ethnic Arabic flavors, coupled with the explosion of multi-ethnic food outlets in the region

6 The sauces & dips product segment is expected to witness the fastest growth at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2019 to 2025, while the paste and spreads segment is projected to generate over USD 985 million in revenue over the forecast period

7 The brick-and-mortar distribution channel generates majority of the revenue in the tahini market, aided by the exponential growth in number of hypermarkets, supermarkets, and specialty stores in emerging economies such as India and Thailand

8 New product launches and production capacity expansions are expected to remain key marketing strategies for notable market players; for example, in August 2018, AllThatDips Company launched an exclusive range of Tahini paste in India under the brand name ‘Beef’, for use in various food products

9 In January 2021, Mighty Sesame Co. launched the first-ever harissa flavored tahini for dressings, dips, meat, and vegetables; harissa is a paste prepared by blending roasted hot red peppers with other spices and herbs

article_4113,"Bull markets are always punctuated by corrections and investing into corrections has proven to be a smart choice – for those who are agile and alert enough to seize the moment. What HDFC AMC’s FlexIndex Plan does is to automate this desire to capture corrections – and thus ensure you get your money into equity at levels you want to enter in. Read on as Ashok Kanawala takes us through this novel facility that enables you to capture corrections automatically for your investors.

WF: What is your FlexIndex Plan and how does it differ from an STP?

Ashok: Historically, when one looks at markets ie when markets are going down, investor are indecisive towards investing and are unable to benefit from the market upside when tide turns over medium to long term. HDFC Flex Index tries to capture the downside of market by automating the process of investment.

HDFC FLEXINDEX PLAN offers investors a tool to plan their investments. This plan could prevent investors from the indecision of investing or not investing in bear/volatile market conditions. It empowers them to automatically transfer investments from select Debt/Liquid Schemes to select Equity Schemes of HDFC Mutual Fund at closing S&P BSE SENSEX levels of their choice.

Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) is a facility to systematically (daily/weekly/monthly/ Quarterly) transfer investments from one scheme to another. STPs helps to take advantage of rupee cost averaging.

WF: How does this facility differ from trigger options that fund houses offer?

Ashok: STP Trigger facility is normally used to redeem/switch investment when it reaches certain threshold based on Date, Value, Capital appreciation and NAV whereas HDFC FLEXINDEX is Index based trigger to invest in select Equity schemes of HDFC Mutual Fund

WF: How many instalments can I choose to set up and what flexibility do I have on amounts to be invested at each specified level?

Ashok: Investors can choose four S&P BSE SENSEX levels of their choice to transfer amounts to HDFC Mutual Fund’s range of equity-oriented schemes. You can choose either Fixed or Flexible Instalment Option.

For more details please refer HDFC FLEXINDEX PLAN.

WF: For how long are these triggers valid and what happens if the triggers are not reached?

Ashok: The validity of the HDFC FLEXINDEX PLAN is 1 year from date of registration. On completion of one year from the date of registration, in case any of the triggers indicated by the investor remains inactive, the proportionate registered amount will be automatically transferred into the Target Scheme in 6 equal monthly instalments on 1st of every month thereafter.

WF: Can I change my mind anytime during this period and reset the triggers for the uninvested portion?

Ashok: The investor has to opt out of the facility by giving a written request to cease the trigger facility and register the new trigger facility.

WF: Can I specify more than one target equity fund for investment at trigger points? Which funds within your range are covered in this facility?

Ashok: For more than one target fund, the investor has to apply separately for each target fund. Following are the eligible schemes:

WF: Do you also have similar triggers to exit from equity funds and move money into debt/liquid funds?

Ashok: No. HDFC FLEXINDEX is conceptualised as a tool to plan investment into volatile assets and hence enables investment into Equity Schemes based on closing S&P BSE SENSEX levels of your choice.

WF: What guidance can you offer distributors on when to suggest a normal STP and when to suggest your FlexIndex Plan?

Ashok: HDFC FLEXINDEX is trigger based investment. Most investors would like to invest when market falls but when market falls like in March 2020, because of PANDEMIC, investor were unable to decide on investment fearing markets would go down further. HDFC Flex index takes out indecision (emotions) of investing and answers to risk associated with missing opportunity. HDFC FLEXINDEX typically works when markets are volatile.

Assuming an investor registered HDFC FLEXINDEX plan on February 1, 2020 and had given four fixed triggers of S&P BSE SENSEX as 38000, 36000, 34000 and 30000. Because of PANDEMIC and lockdown fears the market fell sharply in March 2020 and all four index levels would have triggered :

HDFC Flex Index tries to capture the downside of market by automating the process of investment. It’s not a substitute to Normal STP.

Normal STP is regularly investing small amounts to take advantage of rupee cost averaging. Under normal STP, the investor invests a fixed amount on a regular basis regardless of the ups and downs of the market.

Please read the terms and conditions of HDFC FLEXINDEX Plan carefully before enrolment.

article_4151,"© Provided by News18 iOS 14.5 Will Let iPhone Users Unlock Smartphone Directly via Apple Watch Even While Wearing a Mask

Apple appears to be working on a new feature that will help users unlock their iPhone models with Apple Watch, even while wearing a mask. The new iPhone unlock feature appeared with the first developer beta version of iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4, that Apple started rolling out earlier this week. The public beta versions of iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4 are not yet out though the company may roll out soon. The new unlock feature is similar to Apple's 'unlock your Mac with your Apple Watch.'

According to 9to5Mac, developers need to go to Settings on the iPhone to enable the 'Unlock with Apple Watch' feature. Users then need to search Face ID & Passwords > Enable Unlock with Apple Watch. The report adds that for the feature to work, users must ensure that Face ID detects masks, Apple Watch is nearby the iPhone model, the smartwatch in on your wrist, and Apple Watch has a passcode enabled. Additionally, users will receive haptic feedback on the Apple Watch once the iPhone is unlocked.

#iOS14.5 beta 1, iPhone unlock process with #AppleWatch wearing a facemask Easy and super smooth! pic.twitter.com/ADkE0dVS0I — Luca Ansevini (@Anse1987) February 1, 2021

As expected, the feature would be highly useful amid the COVID-19 pandemic as people are advised to wear a mask whenever they are outdoors. However, this feature will only be limited to iPhone X and above as the newer iPhone flagships only carry the Face ID as biometric authentication to scan for facial features to unlock the device. Alongside the new unlocking system, the iOS 14.5 developer beta brings support for Xbox Series S/ X and PlayStation 5 controllers. The update further carries an updated Fitness app and expanded compatibility for the Apple Fitness Plus workouts. The Cupertino-based tech giant is also expected to unveil the App Tracking Transparency tool that has been criticised by Facebook and several other ad companies.

article_4152,"The budget-friendly Poco M3 launched in India today, adding to the company’s formidable portfolio which propelled it to the third spot in the online smartphone market.

While the Poco M3 made its debut in Europe in November 2020, the Indian variant comes with better specifications without increasing the price by a lot. It is also the first device from the brand to sport a large logo on the brand – a trend that is becoming increasingly common these days. A similar design will be seen on the upcoming Realme X7 Pro that launches later this week.

Poco M3 price in India

ICICI Bank credit card holders will get an additional Rs 1,000 off for the first sale.

The Poco M3 starts at Rs 10,999 in India for the base variant with 64GB of UFS 2.1 storage and goes up to Rs 11,999 for 128GB of UFS 2.2 storage. Colour options include Cool Blue, Power Black and Poco Yellow. It will be available on Flipkart starting February 9 at 12 pm.

The Poco M3 is based on the same platform as the Redmi 9 Power and shares most of its specs. It is powered by the Snapdragon 662 chipset and comes with 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM in India. It is an octa-core chipset built on an 11nm fabrication process which runs at a max frequency of 2.05GHz and has a third-gen AI engine.

The key difference comes with the design, as the Poco M3 opts for a unique back panel with the top one-third consisting of a black glass “visor” which houses the cameras and a bold-coloured plastic back all-around with a faux leather finish.

There are three on the back: a 48MP f/1.79 primary camera, a 2MP macro shooter and a 2MP depth sensor. On the front is an 8MP selfie shooter, which resides in a dot notch. Shooting modes include night mode, portraits, Google lens, movie frame, etc.

The display on the Poco M3 spans 6.53-inches and has a resolution of 2,340 x 1,080, resulting in an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and a screen-to-body ratio of 90.34%. There’s also Gorilla Glass 3 protection on top. Out of the box, it is also Widevine L1 certified for HD video streaming on OTT platforms. A screen protector will come pre-applied on the phone.

The phone houses a large 6,000mAh battery and supports 18W fast charging over the USB Type-C port, with the adapter included in the box. Other features include expandable storage, a side-mounted fingerprint scanner and an infrared blaster. There are also dual stereo speakers, which is a rare feature at this price, along with a 3.5mm headphone jack.

The Poco M3 runs on Poco Launcher 2.0 based on MIUI 12 atop Android 10. There will be no system ads or pesky notifications."
article_4153,"Gurugram, Feb 2 : Expanding its successful M series, Samsung on Monday launched Galaxy M02 with a large 5000mAh battery, good camera and large screen starting from Rs 6,999 (2GB+32GB variant) in India.

article_4154,"PlayStation 5

Let me admit, this was supposed to be a first impression. But, the PlayStation 5 is so addictive that I spent most of my free time over the past week glued to the screen, playing enough games to come up with the review. It took Sony a while to bring the PlayStation 5 to India and now that it's here, this beast of a console is likely to rule for the next few years. It was in 2018 when we first started hearing about PS5, Sony confirmed the launch following year and the first glimpse was shown in early 2020.

By the end of that year, Sony PS5 had launched in most markets, except India. The timing couldn't have been better we were in the middle of the pandemic, gaming was on a rise, people wanted more avenues to kill time and there was a need for more advanced gaming equipment. Sadly, the pandemic was for everyone. So, there was a shortage of supply and whatever was available, was lifted by the scalpers.

In India, the company faced different issues first with the trademark, then with the disrupted supply chains. The gaming enthusiasts got some relief on January 1 when Sony finally announced the India launch for February 2. As expected, the limited stock was sold out within minutes when the pre-orders began on January 12, 2021.

Despite Microsoft's Xbox series arriving earlier, there is clearly high demand for Sony's new-gen console. The temptation is so high that regular gamers have been selling hardware or saving for months so that they can spend Rs 50,000 on the PlayStation (disc variant). But, should you? Is it a genuine upgrade? What are the changes or improvements? Let's look at all that in detail in our Sony PlayStation 5 review.

PlayStation 5 review: Most Futuristic Design

The Sony PlayStation 5 flaunts the most futuristic design on a gadget I have reviewed in long time. Usually, people buy gadgets and blend them with their living room. This one, will force you to make changes to the overall setting. The initial reveal and images put out by gamers around the world gave an idea that the PlayStation 5 is big. But, I wasn't expecting it to be this huge and thick. The disc edition, which we have for the review, is 390mm x 104mm x 260mm (width x height x depth) in size.

This time you have the option to place the console both horizontally and vertically. When placed vertically, the PS5 looks like a gadget straight out of Star Trek, especially with that cool PlayStation logo on one corner. Imagine if Captain James Kirk actually had this thing on the USS Enterprise! His journey to explore new worlds would have ended with running around and completing missions within games.

Now, there are two things that you need to keep in mind when deciding the orientation of the device. First if placed vertically, there is a chance that you might end up covering a part of the television screen with the console, unless it is kept on the sides or on a table of comparatively lower height. In either case, the length of the HDMI cable can play the deciding role.

Second the process to switch between the two orientations is not seamless and requires some work. The PlayStation comes with a base stand that needs to be fixed under the machine in both cases. So, every time you plan to change the orientation, you will have to remove the screw from the stand, change its position, put the screw back and tighten it to make sure that the console doesn't wobble.

The entire process can be tiresome and requires some delicacy to avoid damage. This isn't easy to perform when you're handling a machine that weighs close to 4.5 kgs. Needless to say, the PlayStation 5 looks more glamorous when kept vertically. It features two LED strips one on each side which makes the console really stylish.

Sony has also switched to a 'V' shaped front from a more squarish PS4. I am not sure if it was a conscious decision to remind that this is the fifth-generation console or a mere coincidence but is surely a welcome move. The device comes with a sandwich-like design where the glossy-central part in black is covered by white plates with matte finish on either side.

White colour usually has the tendency of losing the charm earlier than most other options. In the six days, I have had this console at home, it seems capable of keeping dust away, but we will get a better idea with time.

PlayStation 5 review: Inside the Box

For now, the box remains pretty basic. It comes with the console, one DualSense Controller, a USB-A to type-C cable, power cable, manual, HDMI 2.1 cable, user manual and the base stand. The screw to fix the base stand is housed at the bottom of the stand itself. There are no games with the retail unit as of now. The Astro Playroom comes pre-installed, but you can expect Sony to launch bundles in future.

PlayStation 5 review: Advanced connectivity options

The PlayStation 5 comes with more and advanced connectivity options including USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports that Sony classify as a Superspeed USB with 10Gbps speed, an HDMI port that supports HDMI 2.1 to output 4K at 120Hz, and the 2-pin power port. On the front, you get USB-C Superspeed port and a High-Speed standard USB port.

There is of course the disc drive on the standard model and WiFi 6 for internet.

PlayStation 5 review: New UI

Sony has completely overhauled the UI of the PS5 which also reminds you how an upgrade should feel like, especially if it is coming after seven years of wait. The UI is now in HDR, neater and features trendy elements. The main menu now features two tabs Games and Media which ensure that your applications are separated and easy to find. For example, all the gaming titles like FIFA 21, Spider Man: Miles Morales and The Last of US II now appear under the Games tap while apps such as Netflix, Spotify and Prime Video can be accessed from the Media menu. In PS4, everything was listed in the Library folder.

The other major and welcoming change comes in the form of smaller icons, probably inspired by smartphone tiles. It helps achieve a neater look on the home page. So, now when you are on the game icon, the rest of the screen is filled with its artwork. This makes the screen look stunning even without applying a custom theme.

While the new UI focuses to declutter the home page, it also provides more information about each title than before. When you select a game, you can see stuff like Trophy progress, recent news on the game, or even YouTube streams related to it. Most of the times you are probably going to skip this information and just click the play button, but it is a handy update, nevertheless.

The bigger change comes on the in-game menu. Earlier, pressing the PS button would take you to the home screen. Now, it opens a small overlay at the bottom, giving you quick access to several features while staying in the game. These include notifications, volume level, battery status or the ability to stream from a platform. There is also an app switcher which lists down games and apps you have used. But, reboots them when switched.

There is also a hints system which basically helps you clear missions in a game by playing a picture-in-picture video. I have mixed feelings about this one. All of us have spent hours trying to clear tough missions, failing and learning on the way. This feature helps to solve that by giving clues, without having to Google for information. However, it might kill the experience of a game by reducing the struggle. At the end of the day, it depends on gamers what and how much they use this feature for.

PlayStation 5 review: Data Transfer

Transferring the data from your PS4 can also take some time and be frustrating. There are two ways to pull this off by uploading the files on cloud from PS4 and then downloading them on PS5 or, by connecting both the consoles to the same connection and transfer it through WiFi. The first is only available for PS Plus members while the latter takes time to complete. You also need to keep both the consoles running while the transfer happens.

PlayStation 5 review: Welcome to DualSense

The DualSense controller bundled with PS5 boasts of as futuristic design as the console itself. It makes PS4's DualShock controller look silly in almost all departments. The overall design and button placement hasn't changed much but it's the dual tone finish and the haptic feedback that make all the difference. The textured back features icons on the controller. This has been done subtly and is only visible on closer look.

The controller is larger than before and features pointy sticks. The touch panel and rear triggers are slightly larger too which makes them easier to press. The home button still sits in between the sticks with the PS logo etched inside. The rest of the buttons are the same. Another major addition to the controller is a built-in mic which can be used for in-game conversations. There is also an option to mute it.

The inside is where major upgrades happen. The haptic feedback is new, inspiring and elevates your gaming experience to a new level. This can be experienced in the pre-installed Astro's Playroom which is basically designed to take you through the features of the controller. It sends different vibrations as character moves across surfaces to give better experience of what's happening on screen.

The feature prominently comes into effect in FIFA 21 when you pass the ball, engage in a tackle or score a goal. The controller vibrates differently in each case. Even in Miles Morales, a part of the controller vibrates whenever you get text as a smartphone would. As good as this works on the PS5-optimised games, results were slightly disappointing on the older PS4 games. For example, the vibrations seemed out of sync in Gran Turismo Sport. Hopefully, Sony is able to fix that.

The PlayStation 5 also brings an update to the triggers making them adaptive. This means the triggers offer variable tension, offering physical resistance depending on what you're doing. What I noticed while playing FIFA was that the triggers become hard to press while defending but are freer when you are sprinting during attacks.

The enhanced vibrations and more immersive experience mean that the controller drains sooner than you would expect. I managed to get around seven hours of battery life from it which is similar to what you get on the DualShock controllers. The type-C USB cable helps charge the controller faster than before.

One mind baffling decision for me is that the PlayStation 5 is compatible with the DualShock controllers but only for PS4 games. This means your old controllers will still work with games like Gran Turismo, GTA 5 or God of War but not Miles Morales or FIFA 21. This will leave a lot of users divided on whether they should sell the older controllers or not.

The other thing is that as advanced as the DualSense controller is, it is still big. It is also more demanding with the adaptive triggers and adds to the fatigue. I have spent six to seven hours gaming on the PS4, but a couple of hours on the PS5 and your palms start asking for rest.

PlayStation 5 review: Quick and Better

There is no doubt that the PS5 is quicker, better and significantly faster than the PS4. It is powered by a custom eight-core AMD Zen 2 CPU and a custom AMD Radeon RDNA 2-based GPU. This is capable of providing 10.28 teraflops of power with 36 compute units running at 2.23GHz each. The system memory is 16GB. It also comes with solid-state drive (SSD) with 825GB. Out of this, some is already occupied by the system so you eventually get just 667.2GB for usage which might not be enough given the increasing size of games these days.

This is also one of the first challenges I faced. My PS4 game library was close to 800GB and all of that couldn't be transferred to PS5. For example, The Last of US II itself takes over 100 GB on the console and there many others that demand at least 60 to 70GB of storage. So, in best case scenario, you can keep around seven to eight on the PS5 at once. It should force users to spend more external storage.

The PlayStation 5 is a lot faster than the previous-generation console, and this is a welcome move. There have been times when I would start a game and indulge in something else waiting for it load on the PS4. The new console entirely changes that. Games like Miles Morales and FIFA 21 loaded within seconds. Traveling to places through the map is also quicker on Miles Morales now. The navigation within the home screen and other menus feels slick too.

Among the games I tried, FIFA 21, Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Demon's Soul were optimized for PlayStation 5 while WWE 2K20, Gran Turismo Sport, The Last of US II and Go of War were not. Also, I don't own a 4K TV to make the best use of the graphics, but all the mentioned games looked amazing even on FHD. If you have the right TV, the PS5 supports up to 120fps and 4K HDR.

There is a new ray tracing mode as well which improves the lighting and delivers more details in the game. Titles like Miles Morales benefit heavily from this feature. The setting looks more natural than it did in the PS4 version, even though that was great too. There are more realistic reflections from lights, windows etc. In FIFA 21, the players look more realistic, the stadiums are very close to reality, the pitch seems wider, and the gameplay is certainly better finally making it possible to defend against AI.

The console also brings along a feature called 'activities' which lets users boot up games from a specific point, directly from the main menu. It comes really hand in mission-driven games that have checkpoints for saving progress.

The console also seems quitter than the PS4. The previous gen console would make sure to inform that it is running by making a sound in the background all the time. It would also throw a lot of heat. The PlayStation 5 surely does a better job in both these departments. It has a better cooling system. This could also be because the unit is new right now and a better picture will be presented over time.

PlayStation 5 review: Final Verdict

If you have been waiting and saving for the PlayStation 5 to launch in India, let me tell you it was worth it. That's as simple as I can put it. This is how you design and build a next-gen gaming console which feels like a genuine upgrade and is worth the money. The PS5 is a major improvement when it comes to graphics, performance, haptic feedback and overall gaming experience. The DualSense controller is the biggest highlight of the entire package.

Some other year, with some other gadget, I might have advised you to wait for few months and pick a bundle that offers better value for money with an extra controller or game but the mismatch in demand and supply means that it is unlikely to happen anytime soon.

Yes, the size remains to be a topic of debate, but the design is breath-taking. There are other limitations such as lack of Dolby Vision or limited storage but consider the other things on offer, you can definitely consider spending Rs 50,000 on the disc variant. If not, then the digital edition also makes sense at Rs 40,000."

article_4156,"Itel has expanded its budget smartphone segment by adding another offering in its A-series, the Itel A47. The company launched the new smartphone in an exclusive tie-up with Amazon which is the only place the smartphone will be available.

The Itel A47 comes after Itel introduced the A48 and it features an HD+ FullScreen display, curved edges, dual security features and a bigger battery. A47 is priced at Rs 5,499, which the brand justifies by saying its purpose is ‘democratizing technology for masses’ along with ‘Digital India’.

The latest addition Itel A47 is set to go on sale across India starting February 5 at 12 noon onwards.

Itel A47: Specs and features

The Itel A47 comes with a 5.5-inch (13.97cm) HD+ FullScreen display and 2.5D Glass. In terms of cameras it comes equipped with dual 5-megapixel AI camera and 5-megapixel selfie camera with Soft Flash.

article_4157,"When Google announced the launch of its gaming streaming platform Stadia in 2019, CEO Sundar Pichai pitched it as a service that would revolutionise the way people play games.

The idea was that Stadia would let gamers play top-tier without needing to buy and own expensive computers or dedicated gaming consoles. Instead, all games would run on cloud servers in Google’s data centres, and a video feed of the game would be broadcast to the user’s device of choice — such as a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or smart TV.

While it plans to still deliver on that, Google will do it without its in-house Stadia Games and Entertainment (SG&E) development team, which it announced on late Monday would be no more.

“Given our focus on building on the proven technology of Stadia as well as deepening our business partnerships, we’ve decided that we will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team SG&E, beyond any near-term planned games,” Google Stadia VP and general manager Phil Harrison announced in a blog post.

In shutting SG&E, it has seen the departure of VP Jade Raymond, as well as the rest of the team which Harrison said will be “moving on to new roles”.

Going forward, Harrison said Google will focus on working with external game developers and publishers to bring their games directly to players via its cloud streaming platform.

“We see an important opportunity to work with partners seeking a gaming solution all built on Stadia’s advanced technical infrastructure and platform tools. We believe this is the best path to building Stadia into a long-term, sustainable business that helps grow the industry,” he said.

Last month, Google’s parent company Alphabet announced it would be winding down its internet balloon firm Loon, pointing out that the company’s demise was due to a lack of willing partners and an inability to build a sustainable business model.

The company was best known for using giant high-altitude balloons and network partnership with global telcos to beam internet to remote parts of the world.

The former Google X project was spun out as an independent company of Alphabet in 2018 alongside Wing, Alphabet’s drone business.

article_4159,"OnePlus success in the smartphone market has led to the diversification of its products, meaning from just being a smartphone-centric company now it has moved into producing other gadgets as well. In recent times we have seen that the company has ventured into producing smart TV, Bluetooth headphones were already there, and now it has entered into producing wearables. The wearable which we are talking about is the OnePlus Band which we will be reviewing. This is the first product from OnePlus in the wearable segment.

Design

The new OnePlus Band looks just like other fitness bands. It comes with an adjustable strap configuration in a single model. The dimensions of the fitness tracker and the strap are quite similar to other fitness trackers on the market, measuring 40.4×17.6×11.95 mm with a width of up to 21mm which feels very light on the wrist and the straps don’t irritate the skin when you sweat while exercising. With a basic clasp style, the strap features distinctive striated patterns along its length. It’s a shiny, pliant quality that causes the skin to feel good. The default color is black, but extra colored straps can be ordered by the customer. The two other color straps available are Navy and Tangerine Gray. By just pressing lightly, the key tracker can be popped in and out of the strap and the reason for this is that any time you decide to charge the band, you have to pull the tracker out. The tracker and the band are completely water-resistant with an IP68 rating that helps you to use the band even underwater when swimming.

Display

The OnePlus Band has a 1.1-inch, 126×294 pixel AMOLED touchscreen display. Thanks to its self-emitting pixels, the display has bright, well-saturated colors, and completely deep blacks in terms of picture consistency. Also, in direct sunshine, the screen remains easily readable. The brightness level of the band can also be adjusted which you can opt for according to your brightness preference and the amount of battery power which you want to invest in the display. The OnePlus brand has no button, and the entire surface of the front is plain. There is no always-on display on the OnePlus Band. OnePlus does, however, provide one of the best wake detection displays. The display on the OnePlus Band lights up with the slightest turn of your wrist, unlike most other fitness trackers in this price category that require deliberate and dramatic arm gestures to light up their screens.

Functions

The new OnePlus Band comes with four main features which are fitness tracking, heart monitor, SpO2 monitor, and the sleep tracker. The band can track various activities like running, fat burn running, open-air walks, cycling, elliptical exercise, rowing, swimming, and many others. The heart monitoring constantly provides you the information about your heartbeat. The band has a built-in pulse oximeter that measures your peripheral oxygen saturation or SpO2 levels. The pulse oximeter is one such important feature that helps you keep a record of the oxygen level especially when you are hypoxic. OnePlus Band is also able to follow your sleep patterns, including your total length of sleep, deep sleep and light sleep, and your SpO2 levels during your sleep. The band can monitor various activities but it misses out on two sensors which are the menstrual cycle sensor and stress sensor. The lack of these two sensors make the band a little less appealing to the customers and place it behind its rival band which is Mi Band 5. All the data recorded can be seen on the OnePlus Health App. The health app allows you to make changes in the settings of the band like changing the watch faces. The new OnePlus band comes with 37 watch faces.

The band has other smart features as well which include controlling the music, taking pictures of your paired phone with the band. The band also allows you to set alarms. The notifications of your phone also pops-up on the display of the band as well.

Battery

The OnePlus Band comes with a 100mAh battery and claims to provide up to 14 days of battery life on a single charge but when we used the watch rigorously in its higher settings we were able to use the watch only for 7-8 days. However, if you use the watch in its moderate settings you will be able to use the watch for 12 days with a single charge.

Conclusion

The OnePlus Band effortlessly kicks start a new domain for the brand which is cluttered with various offerings from America’s Fitbit to the Chinese Xiaomi and Korea’s Samsung, and like the OnePlus smartphones, this band makes an impact on the first attempt. The band is suitable for the skin, offers a wide range of tracks, from the very demanding oxygen level to your steps, and heartbeat. The 37 watch faces make it fun to wear each day. The battery backup is great and can easily last during long tours without the worry of charge. The display is quite ambient and responsive as well. The ability to control smartphone notifications adds to its benefits. The OnePlus Band sells at Rs 2,499 which makes it an ideal fitness tracker-cum-watch in the market with the trust of OnePlus."

Last year, Samsung stunned all smartphone geeks in India by launching the Galaxy S10 Lite – a watered-down edition of the Galaxy S10 with the more capable Snapdragon 855 Plus chip, a bigger battery, and (most importantly) a cheaper price tag. It was a hit recipe but Samsung followed it up with the Galaxy S20 FE, which did not impress critics as much as its international 5G variant, courtesy of its Exynos 990 chipset. Samsung now possibly wants to fix that with the Galaxy S20 FE 5G.

A report from Pricebaba spotted the Galaxy S20 FE 5G’s support page on Samsung India’s website. The phone was also spotted getting the latest BIS certification, thereby hinting at an imminent launch. The 5G variant is the same as the international variant that used the Snapdragon 865 chip instead of the Exynos 990.

Galaxy S20 FE 5G coming to India

While the Galaxy S20 FE that India got was a good phone overall, it struggled with the inferior Exynos 990 chipset. We reviewed the phone at BGR India and found the phone overheating as well as struggling with resource-intensive games at times. The phone also lacked support for 5G. The international variant, however, got the Snapdragon 865 variant that solved all the issues of the Exynos variant.

In India, the Galaxy S20 FE 5G could retain 95 percent of the same features as the 4G variant, except for the chipset. That means you are going to get the same plastic unibody design with the five-color palette. The display remains the same at 6.5-inches and will offer the same Super AMOLED experience with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. The Snapdragon 865 could help with improved battery life, better image processing, and faster performance (obviously).

What remains to be seen is how Samsung prices the Galaxy S20 FE 5G in India, given that the 4G variant already sells at a fairly high price of Rs 49,999. It is possible that Samsung could discontinue the Exynos variant and bring the 5G version at a similar price. Samsung could also dip the price of the 4G variant and bring the Snapdragon version at a higher price, or vice versa.

Currently, the only Samsung phone in India to use the Snapdragon 865 chip is the ultra-premium Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G. The current-gen Galaxy S21 series is using the Exynos 2100 chipset series."
article_4162,"New Delhi, Feb 2 — Google has announced to shut down its in-house Stadia game development division, as it sees a great adoption of its technology by third-party developers and publishers to create world-class games.

Google said that it will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from its internal development team SG&E, beyond any near-term planned games.

article_4164,"OnePlus entered a new market segment with its Nord series of devices last year. The series brought with itself the original Nord and the more affordable Nord N10 and N100 smartphones. Now, reports suggest the company could add to the list this year by launching a new phone, the OnePlus Nord N1 5G. The phone has been tipped for launch by reliable tipster Max Jambor.

The upcoming smartphone is interestingly being tipped to launch later this year as a successor to the OnePlus Nord N10 5G that went official in Europe and the US. While the report does not reveal any information about the specifications of the device, it does add that it could launch after the OnePlus 9, 9 Pro, and 9E smartphones. As such, the tipster also suggests that we might have to wait a while for the launch of the OnePlus N1 5G. However, considering that the OnePlus Nord N10 5G was launched in October 2020, it can be expected that the OnePlus N1 5G also follows a similar launch timeline this year.

Even as we wait for the launch of OnePlus Nord N1 5G, the company is first scheduled to launch the OnePlus 9 series in India in mid-March. For now, the expectation is the OnePlus 9 series will bring with itself the OnePlus 9, OnePlus 9 Pro and another OnePlus 9 Lite model. The first two are tipped to be powered by the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset, while the latter could be powered by the Snapdragon 870 SoC.

Of the three, the flagships are the most interesting. The latest round of leaks reveals the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro will come with a 3.8mm punch-hole positioned at their upper-left corner with the former getting a 6.55-inch flat panel capable of Full HD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. The Pro model is expected to be equipped with a of 6.78-inches curved edge display which will offer a Quad HD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.

As per reports, OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro will weigh less than 200 grams with the OnePlus 9 tipped to sport a slim profile of 8mm, while the Pro variant could come measuring 8.5mm in thickness.

Previously, we've seen reports about the OnePlus 9's camera module which is being said to be heroed by a 50-megapixel lens. As per a report on SlashLeaks, the phone will feature a three-camera system, the mainstay of which will be a 50-megapixel Ultra Vision wide-angle camera with f/1.9 aperture. The leak also reveals that this lens will be coupled with a 20-megapixel Cine Camera, an ultrawide lens with f/1.8 aperture. As for the third lens in the setup, there will be an OIS assisted 12-megapixel telephoto camera with autofocus and an f/3.4 aperture.

Reports also say that the phone maker is set to partner with Leica for the OnePlus 9 series. As per a well-known tipster, Teme(@RODENT950) multiple phone makers are partnering with Leica to bring their cameras on their phones, and apparently, one of them is the OnePlus.

article_4166,"Poco X3 Pro smartphone has been spotted on several regulatory websites. The device was recently spotted on FCC, EEC certification sites. The IMEI has been registered in India as well which means the device launch is not too far away in India. The Poco X3 will likely be a mid-range phone with flagship processor.

According to a report from XDA-Developers , the upcoming Poco devices will be called the Poco X3 Pro and it was spotted on US FCC site with model number “M2102J20SG”. A device with the same model number was also spotted on the IMEI database.

(Image credit: Aakash Jhaveri)

Further, the report also claims the Poco X3 Pro device is currently code-named “vayu” and “bhima”. These are two different variants of the same phone. The Poco X3 Pro is also expected to be powered by Qualcomm’s SM8150 platform which refers to Snapdragon 855 processor. Further, the phone might be equipped with a quad-camera setup which consists of a 48MP wide camera, an ultra-wide lens, a macro and a depth sensor.

As per the other certifications, the Poco X3 will have support for dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, and 4G LTE. There is no mention of 5G support for now. The Snapdragon 855 is an octa-core chipset with a clock speed of 2.84GHz and built on 7nm fabrication process. OnePlus 7, Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite, Redmi K20 Pro, LG G8X, and more devices are powered by the same chipset.

While the chipset on the Poco X3 Pro seems outdated, it is also worth mentioning that recently Anju Sharma of Poco India said that to create a product like the Poco F1 today is ""next to impossible"". Since the smartphone prices over the last few quarters have also gone along with the cost of 5G components, Poco might pull it off with a 4G only Snapdragon 855 processor which will same them money and also give consumers flagship-grade experience without breaking the bank.

The Poco X3 was launched in India back in September. Today, the company will launch its budget smartphone, the Poco M3.

article_4167,"© Provided by News18 Amkette Evo Fox Game Box Review: Game On, Without Burning A Hole In Your Pocket

There is just something about gaming consoles because even those who wouldn’t otherwise like to be referred to as gamers, suddenly want to plant their backsides firmly inside the warm cushiness of a bean bag and spend hours racing on some of the iconic racetracks in the world or spend a lot of time shooting the heads off the zombies who have taken over what remains of the damned world. That being said, not everyone can afford a Sony PlayStation or a Microsoft Xbox console. What if I was to tell you that most of those games you play on the comparatively small screen of your phone, can be made available on your TV as well. A much larger canvas to enjoy games, isn’t it? Albeit most certainly not in the same league as the Xbox and the PlayStation. That’s exactly what the Amkette Evo Game Box does. Irrespective of whether your TV is a smart TV or not, the Evo Fox Game Box simply adds both dimensions to the experience—gaming and video streaming. But how much money will you have to part with?

The Amkette Evo Fox Game Box is priced at Rs 8,990 and that makes it significantly less of an outlay for a gaming console than what you may have otherwise imagined. That includes the Nvidia Shield gaming console family, which is perhaps the benchmark in the world of Android TV based media players and gaming consoles, and their price tags also support that fact. Here, the promise is simple. The Evo Fox Game Box can deliver Android gaming that you can enjoy on your TV rather than looking down into your phone. After all, this runs Android 9 which has been heavily reworked for the TV screen. And this can be a one-stop video streaming hub as well, with all the popular video streaming apps available for download via the Google Play Store.

© Provided by News18 Amkette Evo Fox Game Box

The core specs of the Amkette Evo Fox Game Box include a quad-core processor, a Mali G31 3D graphics chip, 4GB RAM and 32 GB internal storage. If you intend to download a lot of games, and Android games have this bad habit of further downloading a lot of game data at certain points, you’ll fill this up rather quickly. That’s where the microSD card comes into the picture. The thing with the performance is that it is consistently slick, without any apparent slowdowns or stutters. That’s certainly a positive, particularly when you consider that underneath is still a fairly old Android iteration. There are also two USB ports, but those will be populated in a jiffy because the wireless remote control and the wireless game controller both need dongles to connect with the Amkette Evo Game Box. This, while it works well, just feels a tad old school for a gaming console that is attempting to attract gamers in the year 2021.

The Amkette Evo Fox Game Box is 4K ready, handles gaming as well at that resolution fairly smoothly. There is still some dependence on the actual game and how its tuned, but I noticed that graphics heavy games such as Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3 had occasional stutters and there was some lag in the controller input at 4K, which was sorted as soon as the resolution came to a more controlled 1080p at 60Hz. Yet, at 4K resolution, games such as Ski Safari 2 and Hungry Shark Evolution exhibit absolutely no stutters.

© Provided by News18 Amkette Evo Fox Game Box

A lot of the experience and performance will depend on the game that you intend to play, and whether it can detect the gaming device it is being played on and whether it can adjust and play well with the wireless controller. For instance, the two game titles that I specifically had my attention on the Amkette Evo Fox Game Box are Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3. On the former, the gameplay is fantastic with a very PlayStation 4-esque controller mapping, quick game load times and a very enjoyable experience overall. However, things on the Real Racing 3 title weren’t as smooth. The controller mapping is a bit weird and the game refuses to detect the left turn gesture on the controller. In a Formula 1 race, you wouldn’t last very long if your car refuses to turn left. In the fragmented world that is Android, the Google Play Store and indeed the Android apps and game experience, it is hard to underline an exact strength or weakness of the Amkette Evo Fox Game Box. Nevertheless, what we can say is that it’ll do very well if the game that you intend to run on it has been given enough smarts by the developer. And it’ll be a choppy experience if that isn’t the case.

The Amkette Evo Fox Game Box, on its own end, is ready with the hardware and the software to deliver when the right games come along. The good thing is, there are a bunch of preloaded games too across genres, which can get you started with gaming pretty much from the outset. Beyond that, the Google Play Store is your wide canvas.

One observation that I really cannot mince words with is the interface. Yes, this is a highly customized wrapper meant to bring forward the games on the home screen itself. That being said, the interface itself doesn’t exactly have a modern visual touch to it. Agreed, there is nothing wrong with what it does, which is an attempt to curate some apps and games and also leads you to an app drawer. But it feels a tad too simplistic, with far too many boxed adjusted wherever there was space. And the app drawer just doesn’t have a premium feel to it—there is a very distinct hint of how Android looked a few years ago. I understand this is Android 9 beneath all the wrappers, but if there is customization being done, a bit more tweaking would have helped make it visually better. It is also hard to immediately identify what you’ve selected on the screen in case you get distracted with something else for a moment, and you have to use the direction keys again on the remote to rediscover your exact selection location.

© Provided by News18 Amkette Evo Fox Game Box

You’ll probably also use the Amkette Evo Fox Game Box for video streaming apps quite regularly, if you don’t already have a smart TV. On the plus side, from the get-go, this supports all video streaming apps. Netflix, the usual suspect that has the habit of not playing well with certain video streaming hardware, is available on the console. So are the likes of Amazon Video, Disney+ Hotstar, Sony Liv, Jio Cinema, Zee5 and more. Wherever there is content in 4K, the Evo Fox Game Box reproduces that flawlessly. As long as you also have a 4K TV, that is.

The Last Word: Amkette Evo Fox Game Box Delivers On Gaming As Well As Netflix Binging

There is no doubt in my mind that the Amkette Evo Fox Game Box very much delivers on what it had set out to do, and that is bring smartphone gaming and video streaming to a TV near you. Why be restricted to your phone’s screen size in terms of experience. It has the hardware grunt to get 4K gaming to your TV, at least for games that are optimized to deliver on that promise. The niggles with old-school controller and remote connectivity or even the somewhat dated interface can be easily pushed to one side, once the gaming and Netflix binging fun starts."

It is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processor paired with 4GB of LPDDR4X RAM. In India, the company could bring more RAM options given how important gaming is for consumers out there. The global model of the phone is available in two storage versions including 64GB and 128GB. We will need to wait for the company to reveal details related to the Indian variants of the smartphone.

One of the key highlights of the Poco M3 is the massive 6000mAh battery onboard with support for 18W fast charging. For security, the phone including side-mounted fingerprint sensor and Face Unlock support.

article_4173,"Xiaomi recently launched the Mi 11 smartphone and now speculations and leaks re rife with information about the Mi 11 Pro. Previous leaks suggested that the company would introduce the Mi 11 Pro with a 4,700mAh battery, but new reports claim that it would be a 5,000mAh battery.

The Xiaomi Mi 11 launch event was in China on December 28. We now know what the phone looks like, and its specs, but there's probably going to be a global launch in the coming months where we see the worldwide price and availability.

According to a Chinese tipster's post on Weibo, the Mi 11 Pro will feature the larger than expected battery. The post even suggests that the battery is split in two which could mean the arrival of a new ultra-fast charging technology.

Xiaomi Mi 11: Details

As for the Xiaomi Mi 11, its design builds on that of the Mi 10 - it looks fairly similar on the front, with a 'punch-hole' cut-out in the top-left corner of the screen for the front-facing camera.

Xiaomi states the Mi 11 screen resolution is 2K - that likely means the resolution is about 1440 x 3200, depending on the aspect ratio. It's an AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch input rate. The phone screen has a size of 6.81 inches across, which makes it one of Xiaomi's biggest smartphones.

The Xiaomi Mi 11 has three rear cameras, one fewer than its predecessor, though quality beats out quantity. These are a 108-megapixel main, 13-megapixel ultra-wide and 5-megapixel telephoto macro sensor.

The Xiaomi Mi 11 is the first launched smartphone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset. Xiaomi Mi 11's dual speakers were tuned by Harman Kardon. The Xiaomi Mi 11 will come running MIUI 12.5 based on Android.

Besides the 5,000mAh battery, the smartphone is set to feature 10W Bilateral charging with 55W wired and 50W wireless charging."
article_4174,"Vivo recently launched the Vivo X60 Pro Plus in China, thus completing the X60 series, comprising the vanilla Vivo X60, X60 Pro and Vivo X60 Pro Plus. This new series of smartphones is set to be introduced in India. And they could arrive as soon as within the next 45 to 60 days.

According to the initial reports, the company is reportedly bringing its fully loaded Vivo X60 Pro Plus in the country while it's not clear if the base variant and the X60 and X60 Pro will also accompany their on-steroids sibling.

To recall, with the Vivo X50 series, the company focused on camera-centric features and had marketed the device as one in spite of not supporting processors of flagship grade. However, they did have features ad design that could put any top of the line product to shame. However, the X60 series comes with the latest flagship SoC from Qualcomm.

According to a report by 91mobiles , the Vivo X60 Pro Plus, which presents quite a challenge in pronouncing its name, is heading out of China within months of its introduction in January. The company may launch the phone around the last week of March or in the first couple of weeks of April.

Vivo X60 series price in India

There is no clarity around the Indian pricing of the upcoming flagship series from Vivo yet, however, the vanilla X60 comes in three different variants based on memory and storage combinations back in China. The 8GB RAM+128GB is priced at CNY 3498, the 8GB RAM+256GB is priced at CNY3798 and the 12GB RAM+256GB retails at CNY 3998.

The Vivo X60 Pro only comes in 12GB+256GB and is priced at CNY 4498 back home while the X60 Pro Plus has a couple of variants and the 8GB+128GB is priced at CNY 56400 and the fully-loaded 12GB+256GB variant is pegged at CNY 5998.

Looking at the Chinese pricing, it is clear that the pricing of the X60 series in India may start around Rs. 37,000 for the base variant and the top-end version of X60 Pro Plus could easily be priced around Rs. 68,000 or more.

It also has a 32MP camera at the front housed in a hole punch cutout to take care of selfies and video calls.

Agar aapki pichle mahine ki payment bhi abhi adsense me show ho rahi hai.. Iska matlab hai aapne jo bank detail di hai usme kuch galti hogi jiske karan wo aapki payment sent nahi kar paye.
Aap wo check kare.. Ya dusre bank ki detail double se submit kare.

article_4204,"Mobile Phone Ka Pata Kaise Lagaye Google Par – Find My Phone
April 21, 2018 by Rohit Mewada
Aaj me aapko ek aesi trick bata raha hu jiske baare me har ek Smart Phone rakhne wale Insaan ko pata hona chaiye, Kaise apne khoye hue Mobile ka pata lagaye Google me. Bhut baar hota hai ki hamara mobile kahi rha jata hai ya koi usko chura leta hai, uska pata kaise lagaye. Uska Pata lagana bhut Saral hai Bas Aap ko karna ye hai ki Computer par Google me Search Karo “Find My Phone”. Aap Google par apne Mobile ki location dekh sakte ho ki bo kaha hai or usme ring bhi baja sakte ho.
Table of Contents [hide] [hide]
Mobile ki khojne ke liye in steps ko follow karo (Find My Phone)
Mobile ki location Pata karne ke liye ye function hona jaruri hai
Mobile Phone Ka Pata Kaise Lagaye Google Par | Find My Phone Video
Mobile ki khojne ke liye in steps ko follow karo (Find My Phone)
mobile gum ho jaye to kya kare or kaise search kana hai Google par apne Phone ko. taki Phone ki location pata chal sake or Chor ka pata lagana aasan ho jaye.
#1. Sabse phele Google.com par jao fir usme type karo “Find My Phone” jesa aapko niche ki image me dikh raha hai. jiska matalb hota hai mera phone kaha hai.
#2. Automatically Google par ek Map aa jayega. Ab aapko Apne us Gmail account me login karna hai jo aapne mobile me dala hai.
#3. Jese hi Aap Sign in karoge Google aapke mobile ko search karne lageha
#4. Jese hi aapke Mobile ki location Google ko pata chalegi aapko Google Map par dikhne lagegi. Mobile ki jo location hogi uska ek area hoga 24 meter ka.
#5. Ab aap us jagha par jaa kar apne mobile ki ring baja sakte ho. Uske liye ring ki button par click karo.
#6. Ab aapke mobile me ringtone bajne lagegi Full volume me or bo 5 minute tak bajegi.
Achi baat ye hai ki agar aapka mobile silent bhi hai to bhi bo full volume me bajega.
Mobile ki location Pata karne ke liye ye function hona jaruri hai
Location ki jo service hai bo chalu hona chaiye aapke mobile me
Google App Install hona chaiye aapke mobile me or sabse latest version hona chaiye.
Mobile me Net chalu hona chaiye
Ye jo Mobile ko search karne ka function hai bo abhi Computer par hi karta hai. Aap kisi dusre mobile se nahi pata kar sakte apne mobile ki location ka.
Mobile Phone Ka Pata Kaise Lagaye Google Par | Find My Phone Video
Ab aap jaan chuke hai phone kho jaye to kaise dhunde fir bhi agar aapka koi sabal hai to aap comment karke puch sakte hai, or agar aap ko iske aalawa bhi koi tarika hai to uske baare me Please muje batana naa bhule.

Muje lagta hai aap adsense kya hai aap samje nahi.
AdSense par account jab banta hai jab Hamare pass koi jgha ho jaha par ham ads dikha sakte. Youtube or website Hona jaruri hai.
Account banane ke baad hame adsense ke ads dikhane padta hai usse Hamari income hoti hai. Youtube pe to direct aa jate hai par website par ads ke code lagana padta hai adsense account se.
AdSense par income jab hoti hai jab koi dusra Hamari site par ads dekhege hai. Thud me dekhne se koi income nahi hoti or aesa karne par Hamara account delete bhi ho sakta hai.
Simple sabdo me aapke sabaal ka jabab du to ham ek mobile se direct paise nahi kama sakte

Aap apna facebook account ko delete karna chate ho to aap yaha click karo.
Aap jis account ko delete karna chate ho usme phele login karo.
Fir jo mene link batao hai uspar click karo.
Fir jab aap delete account ki button par click karoge to aapse ek bar fir aapka password or ek sabd verify karna hai.
Ab aapka account kisi ko nahi dekhega. Par bo abhi permanent delete nahi huaa hai.
Aap 14 din tak agar login nahi karoge to bo permanent delete ho jayega. Agar aap chahe to 14 ke phele login Karke apna account ko delete hone se Bachana sakte ho. 14 din ke baad koi option nahi hai account ko bapas Lane ka.

article_4205,"Mobile se Blog Post Kaise Publish kare [Mobile Blogging]
November 18, 2018 by Vishal Gauswami
Badete Internet use ke sath Blogging ka Trend bhi badi teji se badh raha hai, aese me bhut log blogging field me aa rahe hai. Ab aese me bhut log aese bhi hai jinke Pass khud ka computer nahi hai to wo Mobile se hi Blogging karte hai.. Unki hi help ke liye ye post hai jinme ham janege Mobile se Blog post kaise publish kare.
Blogger ke liya Jaruri App konse hai jo uski list pehle hi share ki hui hai aap wo apps bhi jarur install karke rakhe..
abhi ham unhi me se kuch apps ki madad se Blog Post Publish kaise karna hai wo sikhege.
Table of Contents [hide] [hide]
Mobile se Blog Post Kaise Publish kare
1. Mobile App se Post Publish kare
i.a) Blogger Official App
i.b) WordPress Official App
ii) Bloggeroid App
2. Mobile Browser Se Post Kare
Mobile se Blog Post Kaise Publish kare
Mobile se wese Blog Post Publish karne me direct Chrome Browser se kar sakte hai.. par utni choti si screen se post ko likh kar publish karne me bhut si problem ka samna karna padta hai.. to aese me aap Apps ka use kar sakte hai.
1. Mobile App se Post Publish kare
Mobile se Post ko publish karne ka sabse pehla tarika to hai aap Mobile Apps ki madad se post publish kare, jisme likh kar publish karne ka option ho.
i.a) Blogger Official App
Agar aap Blogger use karte hain to phir Blogger ka official aap aapko Google Play Store par mil jayega. Blogger me post karne niche padhe.
Step 1: Google Play Store se Blogger app install kare. Uske baad Blogger app ko khole.
Blogger App
Step 2: Jab aap pehli baar yeh app kholenge toh aapko log in k liye puchha jayega. Fir aapke samne aapke Google Accounts ya gmail ID dikhai denge. Unme se aapka blog hai woh ID select kare.
Step 3: Ab aapko apke blogs ki last me ki gaye posts dikhai dengi. Nayi post likhne k liye Upar corner pe diye gaye Pencil k nishan par Tap kare.
Step 4: Apni post ka Title likhe aur post ka varnan likhe. App image ki madad se photo bhi add kar sakte hain. Niche se apni post ka Label select kare. Aur Publish Arrow par Click karte hi apka post publish ho jayega.
Limitations: Iss app ka samse bada limitation yeh hain ki aap is app se agar 1 se jyada photos add karenge to kabhi kabhi apki post publish nahi hogi.
i.b) WordPress Official App
Jis trha Blogger ka App hai, WordPress ke app me bhi login karke Blog par Post ko Publish kiya ja sakta hai.
WordPress App
WordPress App ka use karna aasan hai, agar aapka blog wordpress par hai to aap jarur use kare.. agar aapko kahi dikkat aaye to aap comment karke puch sakte hai.
ii) Bloggeroid App
Blogger me App ki madad se Post karne ke liye wese to Official Blog hai, par Post ko sahi formate me post ko likhne ke liye hame iss app ki jarurat padegi.. jisme ham bina HTML Code ko edit kare Text ko Bold, italic, URL add kar sakte hai.
Ye Blogger ka Official App to nahi hai, par ye bhi bilkul free hai, jikka naam Bloggeriod hai.
Step 1: Google Play Store se Bloggeriod app install kare aur app open kare.
Bloggeroid
Step 2: Jab aap pehli baar yeh app kholenge toh aapko log in k liye nahi puchha jayega. Yaha par sidhe aapko ek post likhna hoga. Aap ko App ke home page par Post title, Post description aur Tags nazar aayenge.
Step 3: Apni post ka Title likhe aur post ka varnan likhe.
Post me image add karne k liye app ke Menu main jaaye. Usme add image par click karke image select kare. Aap ko [image 0] aisa nazar aayega. Chinta na kare yeh aapka select kiya hua photo hi hain.
Link add karne ke liye aapko niche k format me likhna hoga.
[Google http:www.google.com]
Step 4: Niche Tag ki jagah me apni Post ka Tag likhe or sab complete hone ke baad Publish kare.
pehli war post publish karne par aapko account connect karke allow karna hoga, uske baad post blog par publish ho jayegi.
BENEFITS – Blogger me sab se jayada speed se post karne k liye yeh app bahut upayogi hain. Aap ek saath kai saare photos ko bhi asaani se publish kar sakte hain.
2. Mobile Browser Se Post Kare
Blog ko manage karna Computer se aasan hota hai q ki badi screen hone ke karan sari chije ache se dikhai deti hai… par Mobile Browser me bhut se chije hidi ho jati hai..
To aagar Computer ki trha Mobile Browser me kaam karna hai to aap Puffin Browser ka use kare, jisme sabhi website Desktop Version me open hoti hai.. or Browser me Mouse courser bhi rehta hai.
Puffin Browser App
Puffin Browser Install karne ke baad, aap apni website me login karke usko manage kar sakte hai.
Puffin Browser ka post publish karna to aasan hai hi, par uske aalawa aap Apne blog ki design bhi edit kar sakte hai.
Agar Computer nahi hai to blog ko choti screen me computer ki trha manage karne ke ye ssabse best tarika hai.
Toh ye the aasan tarika Mobile ki madad se blog post publish karne ka. Bhut se mere Blogger Dost hai jo apnepure blog ko Mobile ki madad se hi manage karte hai to chalate hai. to aap bhi chala sakte hai.
Happy Blogging..!

Backlink banane ka koi limit ya rule nahi hai. Wada ye dhiyan rakhe back link natural lagna cahiye. Kyu ki google ye nahi dekhta ki hamne kitni back link banai.. google ki najar me websites ne hame back link di hui hoti hai.. to agar ham hadd se jada backlink banate jayege to wo samaj jayege ki ye khud se bana rahe hai. Jo ke hamare website ke liye tikh nahi hai.

Bahut accha tips hai aur mai to samajhta hu ki agar hum whatsaap ka use kare to hum bahut accha paise kama sakte hai. Aap ka kya kehna hai Rohit.
Rohit ek personal baat share karunga ki aaj kal ke bloggers ek dusre se itna jalte hai ki kya batau. Rohit mera to manna hai ki agar koi blogger successful banna chahta hai to humko unki help karni hogi jo aap acche se karte hai. Unko ye dar lagta hai ki ye blogger bahut accha hai jo ki mujhse age nikal jayega par ye to humare liye accha hai agar wo paise kama rahe hai to aapko jalna nahi hai balki kyunki wo aapse ya phir aapke paise thodina cheen rahe hai wo to company usse pay karti hai.
Rohit agar hum dusre ko successful hone me help karnege to yakeen maniye bhagwan aapko bahut jyada success dega aur me to ye believe karta hu jalne me kuch bhi nahi rakhha he duniya me. Hume ek dusre ko support karna hi hoga.

Rohit Maine to kuch aise bloggers dekha hai jo ki comments tak approve nahi karte agar unko feel hota hai ki ye blogger mujhse behtar hai are hai to accha hai na kya aap uske change kar doge kya?
Agar aap comment nahi approve karenge ko bahut se dusre blog hai jaha par wo comments kar sakte hai. Par us blogger pe aapke prati lifetime tak cheed ki bhawna rahegi jo ki bahut hi galat hai.
Jisko successful blogger banna hai to wo banke hi rahega aap kuch bhi nahi kar sakte to phir ye jalan aur cheed kyun rakhe.Aapka kya kehna hai Rohit ?

Jb bhi aap first time apna koi blog create krte ho to aapko 3 important SEO Tools and plugin jarur apne wordpress pr install krne hain.
Google Search console
Google search console ke jariye aap apne blog ko google ki list me submit kr skte ho jiske bad hi aapka blog google search results pr show hona shuru ho jata hai. sath hi google search console ki help se aap ye bhi pta lga skte ho aapke kon-kon se keyword google pr rank kr rhe hain or aapke technical seo issues ke bare mai bhi aap google search console aapko btata hai.
Google Search Console ki Important setting yaha share ki hui hai jo bhut log najar andaj kar dete hai.. agar aapne nahi ki to jarur kare.
Google Analytics
Google Anaylitics ke jariye aap apne Blog ke bare me sb kuch pta kr skte ho aapke blog pr traffic kitna aa rha hai konse plateform se aa rha kon-kon se pages pr jyada traffic aa rha hai.
Set Up Yoast SEO Plugin
Aapko apne blog pr Yoast SEO plugin ko bhi install krna hai ye bhaut help krega aapko apne on-page SEO ko better bnane me. Yoast SEO plugin aapko pure blog ka kaise perfectly on page SEO krna hai or aapne kya -kya glti ki hai ye sb indicate krta hai.
Yoast SEO ka best alternative Rank Math bhi bhut acha plugin hai jo abhi new hai par Yoast se jada feature isme hai.. aap iska bhi use kar sakte hai.
Tip #2: Un keywords ko find kare jo aapke visitor search kr rhe hain
Blog ke SEO me sbse important or first step hota hai ki aap apne topic se related un keyword ko find kare jo aapke visitor google pr search kr rhe hain. ab sawal aata hai ki aise keywords ko find kaise kare?
Aapne dekha hi hoga ki aap jb bhi google ke search bar mai kuch search krte ho to google phle hi kuch suggestion dene shuru kr deta hai wo wahi suggestion hote hain jinhe log google pr search kr rhe hote hain.
To aapko esi tarike ka istemal krna hai, aap jis bhi topic pr Blog Post likhna chahte hain, use Google ke search bar me likhna hai or enter press nhi krna hai aapko Google kuch suggestion dega wahi aapke main keyword bn skte hain kyonki unhe log search kr rhe hain. or apna main keyword hmesha long tail rakhne.
Iske alawa bhi kai sare keyword research tool hain jinme se kuch free hote hain to kuch paid bhi hote hain. jo free tool hote hain unme google keyword planner aata hai jise aap istemal kr skte ho kyonki yahan pr khud google hi keyword ke bare mai aapko btata hai or sath hi aap Ubbersuggest ka bhi use kr skte ho.
Tip #3: Keyword Optimize Content
3rd jo tips hai wo hai aapne keyword find kr liya ab aapko apne article me sahi tarike se us keyword ko optimize krna hai.
Neeche me aapko kuch points ke jariye btane wala hun aapko apne article me kon-kon si jgh pr keyword ka istemal krna hai. iske liye aap On Page SEO ko jarur tikh se samje.
Title Tag
Sbe phle aapko apne article ke title me apne main keyword ka istemal krna hai jaise aapka main keyword hai. form example aapka main keyword hai Best SEO tips in hindi(2020) to aap ese apne title me use kr skte ho jaise Blog pr Organice traffic kasie bdhaye? Best SEO tips in hindi(2020).
Use main keyword in first para and last para
Aapko apne article ke first para mai apne main keyword ka istemal krna hai or apne article ke last para me bhi aapko apne main keyword ka istemal krna hai.
Use main keyword in Article URL
Aapko apne main keyword ko apne article ke url jisse hm permalink bhi khte hain wahan bhi use krna hai or apne article ke url ko jitna ho ske small rakhne ki koshish kare.
Use main keyword in H1, H2 and H3 Heading
Apne maine keyword ko article ke H1, H2 or H3 heading mai bhi use kare. Halanki aapke article ka title H1 mai already hota hai to apko uske bad H2, H3 mai apne main keyword ka istemal krna hai.
Tip #4: Find and Fix Technical SEO Problem
Jb aap kabhi bhi google search console pr jakar apni website ke ranking factor ko dekhte honge to aapko wahan pr kuch technical issue bhi show hote honge unhe aapko fix krna hai kyonki es issues se bhi aapki google ranking pr effect pdta hai.
optimize your Blog or website mobile friendly
aaj ke time pr mobiles ki value kafi jyada ho gyi hai or agr aapka blog ya website mobile mai ache se open nhi hoti to aapki ranking google me neeche aa skti hai isliye apne blog ko mobile-friendly banaye.
Mobile First Index ab ranking signal bhi hai Google ka.
Improve your Blog or website loading speed
Aapke blog ya website kitna time leta hai open hone me ye bhi bahut important factor hai google ranking me isliye apne blog ya website ki loading speed fast rakhne.
Aap jbb bhi kabhi apne article me images ka istemal kare to image compress krke use kare. jarurat se jyada plugins ka istemal na kare or bekar files ko delete kare. Apne website or blog pr jyada images video ka istemal na kare.
Aapko google pr kafi sare free tool mil jayenge jisse aap apne blog ya website ki loading speed check kr skte ho. jese pingdom
Tip #5: Create High-quality content
Internet ki duniya me wahi king hota hai jiska content super hota hai isliye kaha bhi jata hai “content is king” isliye jbb bhi aap koi article likhen chahe wo kisi bhi topic pr ho use in-depth me likhen.
High Quality Content se matlab hai ki jb bhi koi visitor aapke topic se related query ko lekar aapke article pr pahuche to use sare confusion aapke article ko read krne ke bad clear ho jaye sath hi apne article ko simple rakhe taki user ko easily smjh aa ske or aapki bounse-rate bhi kam ho jisse aapko google ranking kafi help milegi.
2020 me aap apne Article se relaed video, images or infographics ka bhi use kr skte ho eese bhi aapko google ranking improve krne me kafi help milti hai.
Tip #6: Create High-quality Backlink
Kuch time phle tk agr aap apne blog ko Forums, directory ya fir web-2.0 ke jariye kafi backlink bna lete the to aapko maybe google me top ranking mil jati.
lekin ab agr 2020 me aapne aisa kiya to aapko google rank to nhi krega lekin haa penalty jarur de dega . isliye 2020 me aapko only high-quality backlink hi banane hain. wo aap kaise bna skte ho mai aapko neeche btane wala hun.
High Quality Backlinks banane ke 6 tarike aap yaha dekh sakte hai.

article_4211,"The Infinix Smart 5 was launched recently in the sub-Rs. 8,000 price segment as the newest addition to the Smart series. When I unboxed this smartphone, I was surprised to see how big it is, thanks to the bigger-than-usual battery capacity, considering its price. The Smart 5 has some decent specifications on paper, and an attractive starting price of just Rs. 7,199. Does that make it the best pick for those on a very tight budget? I put the Infinix Smart 5 to the test to find out.

Infinix Smart 5 design
The Infinix Smart 5? 7,199 is physically bigger than most other smartphones in this price range. The front is dominated by a 6.82-inch HD+ display with fairly thick bezels all around. The bottom chin is thicker than the sides, but it's acceptable given the price of the smartphone. At the top of the display sits a selfie camera in the dewdrop notch, along with a big earpiece just above it. This earpiece also doubles up as a loudspeaker. The Smart 5 has a selfie flash that's hidden in between the display and the frame, just like on a few other Infinix smartphones.

One of the first things I noticed about the Smart 5 was its weight. At 207g it is among the heaviest smartphones in its price range. A lot of the weight comes from the big 6,000mAh battery. You will notice how bulky this phone is when you pick it up. Infinix has tried to make this less apparent by curving the sides to make gripping the device better.

The Smart 5 has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, which I found to be placed slightly higher than ideal. You'll find the power and volume buttons on the right side of the frame. The power button is convenient but reaching the volume buttons might require you to shuffle the phone in your hand. The Smart 5 has the SIM tray on the left, and it has two Nano-SIM slots as well as a microSD card slot.

Infinix offers the Smart 5 in four colour options: Morandi Green, 7° Purple, Obsidian Black, and Aegean Blue. I had the Aegean Blue variant for this review. Infinix has gone with a flow pattern on the back of the Smart 5 which pops when light hits it. The back is glossy and is a fingerprint magnet. There is a dual-camera setup at the back, and Infinix has designed it to look like there are three cameras. Thankfully, the module doesn't protrude a lot and sits nearly flush with the rear panel.

At the bottom, the Smart 5 has a Micro-USB port, with a 3.5mm headphone jack and the primary microphone on either side. Infinix ships a screen protector in the box along with a plastic case. You also get a 10W charger in the box.

Infinix Smart 5 specifications and software
The Smart 5 has modest hardware. It is powered by the MediaTek Helio G25 octa-core processor. This processor also powers the Xiaomi Redmi 9A, which is similarly priced. Infinix has paired the Helio G25 with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. There is only one configuration of the Smart 5, so if 2GB of RAM seems inadequate for your needs, you might have to look elsewhere. Storage on the other hand is expandable by upto 256GB using the microSD card slot.

Connectivity options on the Smart 5 include Bluetooth 5, VoWiFi, and Dual 4G VoLTE. The phone runs Android 10 with Infinix's custom XOS 7 UI on top. Infinix has made some customisations and you do get a few apps and games preinstalled on the smartphone. Palm Store, an alternative to the Play Store, is one of the preinstalled apps. It kept pushing notifications for different apps and games at least once a day. I couldn't find a way to uninstall the app, but could disable it.

The UI on the Infinix Smart 5 is easy to use and I did not have any issues finding what I was looking for. There is theme support and you can customise the UI your way. Infinix has also added a Game Mode on the Smart 5 which turns off auto-brightness and prevents the phone from switching between data and Wi-Fi while you are gaming.

Infinix Smart 5 performance
This is one area in which the Smart 5 might disappoint heavy users. The Helio G25 is capable of handling casual usage, but ramp up the workload and it stutters while delivering. With only 2GB of RAM, there isn't a huge scope for multitasking, and I found the Smart 5 constantly killing apps in the background to keep RAM free. This is expected given the price it is targeted at. For people who only have simple requirements and don't do much at the same time, such as watching videos or using messenger apps, the performance is just about adequate.

I found the fingerprint scanner at the back to be accurate, and unlocking the Smart 5 was quick. The phone uses its earpiece as the loudspeaker and I found the volume to be adequate for video watching. The display of the Smart 5 is decent indoors but I found it to be reflective outdoors.

The Smart 5 was put through our usual benchmarks, and it managed to score 88,375 in AnTuTu. In PCMark Work 2.0, it scored 5129 points. In Geekbench 5's single-core and multi-core tests, the Smart 5 managed to score 130 and 453 points respectively. The Smart 5 also managed 27fps and 5.3fps in graphics benchmark GFXBench's T-Rex and Car Chase scenes respectively. The Smart 5 performed better than the Nokia 2.4 (Review), but was behind the Redmi 9 (Review) in a few tests.

I loaded up Call of Duty Mobile, and the phone was able to run it at Low graphics quality with the frame rate set to medium. I did notice stutters while playing this game, and the smartphone did slow down occasionally. If you are a gamer hoping to play titles like Call of Duty Mobile, the Smart 5 isn't going to be satisfactory. After playing this game for ten minutes, the phone was barely warm to the touch, and showed a 2 percent battery drop which is acceptable.

You see the advantages of the low-power HD+ display and the Helio G25 processor when it comes to battery life. The Smart 5 lasted me beyond a day and a half of everyday usage without any issues. It lasted 22 hours and 25 minutes in our HD video loop test. A downside of the big battery is that charging takes a ridiculously long time, even when using the bundled 10W charger. The phone only got to 18 percent in 30 minutes and 36 percent in an hour. Charging it completely took over two and a half hours.

Infinix Smart 5 cameras
The Infinix Smart 5 has a dual-camera setup for a budget phone, consisting of a 13-megapixel primary camera and depth sensor. At the front, it has an 8-megapixel camera and a selfie flash. The camera app is quite basic and easy to use. The primary camera uses AI and was fairly quick at detecting the scene I was shooting.

Daylight shots taken with the Smart 5 were strictly average and had slight grain visible on zooming in. The Smart 5 did occasionally overexpose the sky in a few shots, failing to meter light correctly. Text at a distance wasn't legible either.

The Smart 5 was a bit slow at times to lock focus when shooting close-ups. When it did, it managed to capture good shots with a soft background blur. Portrait shots can be taken using the Bokeh mode but you don't get the set the level of blur. Edge detection was hit-or-miss.

Selfies taken with the 8-megapixel shooter were average in daylight but low-light performance was poorer. You can use the selfie flash for a brighter result but it doesn't make a significant difference to image quality.

Verdict
The Infinix Smart 5 is a budget smartphone with a big display and a big battery. Given these USPs, this phone is good to watch videos on and play casual games. You also won't have to charge it very often since it offers good battery life. However, with only 2GB of RAM, the performance isn't the best we have seen at this price level. The Poco C3? 6,999 (Review) and Micromax In 1B (Review) are suitable alternatives to the Infinix Smart 5, offering better performance for roughly the same price. The Moto E7 Power is also expected to launch soon, and could be an interesting alternative."
article_4212,"A Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 smartphone has reportedly caught fire in a woman's purse in New York. According to a report by The New York Post, the incident happened earlier this month and now the victim has filed a suit.

A Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 smartphone has reportedly caught fire in a woman's purse in New York. According to a report by The New York Post, the incident happened earlier this month and now the victim has filed a suit.

According to the report, the woman claimed that the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 had gotten extremely hot while she was using it. She then went on to put it in her purse. Soon after that, she heard a weird noise from her bag which she described as ""whistling and screeching"" sounds. This was followed by thick smoke coming out of her handbag.

The woman then tried to empty the contents of her purse on an elevator floor but to no avail. The smoke and sounds only stopped after a man picked up the phone with a piece of cloth and put it in a bucket full of water.

The new incident re-surfaces the issues that Samsung Galaxy Note 7 owners faced two years ago. The device had to be discontinued within months of its launch. The main issue with the Note 7 was the battery unit. Samsung's initial response was to recall the devices and replace the battery packs. However, some devices that were marked safe also reported cases of fire. The company released a public apology for the same and stopped producing and supplying the Note 7.

In the next cycle, Samsung released the Galaxy Note 8. However, this time around, they placed a much smaller battery with a capacity of 3300mAh. The company was trying to play safe but the device owners complained about considerably short battery back-up.

This year, Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 9 with a huge 4000mAh battery to keep up with the growing battery standards in the industry. To assure safety to the new buyers, Samsung's head of mobile business, DJ Koh cleared the air by saying that Note 9 batteries are safe and have undergone an 8-step test.

In a statement, Samsung claimed that no other incidents related to the Galaxy Note 9 have been reported so far and the company is already investigating the matter. If Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9 suffers the same fate as Note 7, the company might have to consider discontinuing the entire line-up."
article_4213,"Oh, no, is Google about to have its Galaxy Note 7 moment? A swathe of Pixel 3 and 3XL owners have reported damage to their handsets due to swollen batteries.

According to numerous threads on the Google Support forum and Reddit, bulging batteries are causing the back panels of some Pixel devices to pop off. The threads, which date back to May, were first spotted by AndroidPolice. Curiously, AndroidPolice founder Artem Russakovskii’s Pixel 3 suffered from the same issue.

The cause remains unclear, but a common thread between reports is that the swelling appeared shortly after the devices’ wireless charing started to malfunction — or stopped working altogether. Some users are speculating it’s precisely the use of wireless charging and the heat associated with it that’s accelerating the swelling.

We’ve reached out to Google to ask about what might be causing the issue, and will update this piece accordingly if we hear back.

Aside from the obvious safety hazard, the swelling also compromises the IP68 sealing against water and dust, which could cause further damage to handsets.

The good thing is that, according to AndroidPolice, Google seems to be offering free replacements even for devices out of warranty. The company does, however, note this is a one-time deal, and won’t be swapping devices if the issue persists in replacement units.

To be fair, battery swelling isn’t a completely uncommon issue — but not for phones only 2 years old. The timing also couldn’t be any worse, with the new Pixel 5 slated to drop later this month, and likely won’t help with Pixel’s ever-dwindling sales.

Samsung infamously had to recall and discontinue its Galaxy Note 7 series after its phones began exploding left and right. The company eventually identified two design shortcomings in the battery as the culprit. Fortunately, Pixel owners haven’t reported any explosions so far.

Apple, too, had to launch an official probe into its battery design after numerous iPhone 8 owners complained about swelling in their devices back in 2017.

Unlike Apple and Samsung, though, Google’s reputation as a phone-maker is still flimsy — and a hardware debacle like this could spell trouble for its already bleeding phone brand.

Even after the disastrous Note 7 release, Samsung was able to bounce back almost unscathed. Google, on the other hand, has historically struggled to turn the Pixel into a commercial success in spite of receiving generally positive reviews across the board.

Truly, a #batterygate moment is the last thing Google needs ahead of the Pixel 5 launch."
article_4214,"In a recent case of smartphone explosion, a Realme 5 smartphone caught fire and exploded while it was in the user's pocket.  The incident took place in Haryana, India. While this seems like yet another smartphone explosion case leaving the company in a weird position, this time, it turns out that Realme wasn't really at fault. Read on to know more what really happened and what is Realme's reply to the same.

Realme 5 caught fire
According to a report by Mysmartprice, Amit Rathi, a resident of Haryana saw his Realme 5 catching fire when he was riding his bike on March 17 and exploded in no time. Due to this, Rathi experienced minor burns on his as the smartphone was in his pocket when the incident took place.

It is suggested that Amit charged his smartphone with the original charger that came with the box and the bill is dated back to October 21, 2019. In addition to this, the report suggests that when taken the case was reported to Realme, a free replacement was offered. However, when the Amit reached to the customer care service, the executive demanded 50% of the total price of the Realme 5.

Realme's response
We, at Indiatvnews.com, contacted Realme and found out the truth indeed. Realme has suggested that the Realme 5 was damaged by external forces due to which the battery was damaged and it eventually caught fire. 


Realme, in a statement issued to Indiatvnews.com, said, ""The user's phone battery caught fire, and we have analyzed the phone. The phone was badly deformed by external forces, and the battery was punctured, causing the battery to catch fire. From the user's point of view, we have offered him a discount, asking him to replace a new mobile phone with 50% of the cost of his paid mobile phone, but the user did not agree, so he complained to social media. Please note that we are now in further communication with users.""

Upon investigating into the matter, Realme provided us with an excel sheet and a couple of images suggesting that the smartphone was broken and deformed due to heavy external force applied on the frame, on the battery position, and another side of the device.

As a reminder, recently, a Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro also caught fire and blasted. As compensation for the same, Xiaomi gave the victim a free Redmi Note 7 Pro and a Xiaomi Mi backpack.

The aforementioned cases are a reminder that we should handle our smartphones with care and ensure they are not subjected to any manhandling so that our smartphones remain safe."
article_4215,"iOS 14 problems
(Image credit: Apple)
iOS 14 problems can spoil Apple's otherwise beautiful iPhone software upgrade, so we're here to help you fix the iOS 14 bugs and glitches that you may run into.

Broken Wi-Fi, poor battery life and spontaneously reset settings are the most talked about iOS 14 problems, according to iPhone users. Luckily, Apple's iOS 14.0.1 update fixed many of these early issues, as we've noted below, and subsequent updates have also addressed problems.

That said, while some bugs have been solved, a few nasty ones persist. Not only that, but some updates have brought new problems, with iOS 14.2 for example leading to battery issues for some users.

ADVERTISING

Most issues are more annoying than severe, but even then they can ruin the experience of using an expensive phone. Below you'll find the most widely reported issues along with any fixes for them - which in many cases just means updating your software, because as of iOS 14.4, a lot of the issues have been solved.

Don't see your iOS 14 problem listed? We're happy to troubleshoot it with you. Please follow us and share your problem, and we'll either reply or direct message you (if it's a long one) with a solution if we find one.

Below, we’ll explain the top iOS 14 problems along with any fixes that have been figured out so far. Some of the issues are solved by simply updating to the latest version of iOS; when we note that an update addressed the issue, consider it fixed for every later version of iOS unless we say otherwise. 

To update to the latest version, head to Settings > General > Software Update > Download and Install, and click Install Now when the option becomes available.

How to get iOS 14 on your iPhone
iOS 14 text notifications not appearing - Solved
More and more users are lamenting that text message notifications aren't working properly - specifically, texts are going through, but notification bubbles aren't always popping up. There are reports that even the red bubble may not appear either, even if you have unread texts. 


It's annoying, irregular, and means you have to fully open your Messages app to manually check if you have new texts or iMessages.

iOS 14 problem solved: As part of iOS 14.3, Apple fixed a bug causing message notifications not to be received, so updating to iOS 14.3 or later should solve the problem.

iOS 14 won't download on your iPhone
Technically, you're not on iOS 14 yet, and that's the first major problem. If you have a compatible iPhone, you should be able to get the latest software update. Make sure you're iPhone is the iPhone 6S series or newer.

You'll also need enough space on your device to download iOS 14 and the battery needs to be charged. It's best to install iOS 14 when your iPhone is plugged in. If you previously tested the beta, delete that version of the software in Settings > General > Profiles.

Battery drains faster
Some users are reporting that, after installing iOS 14, their batteries have drained at an alarming rate, like this iPhone owner in Apple's official forums. This problem hasn't been fixed with an update at the time of writing, and what's more, the update to iOS 14.2 is seemingly causing similar battery issues for other users.

While the issue hopefully will be patched, there are things you can do in the meantime.

For one thing, this issue regularly happens to some users when they install a new version of iOS. When upgrading to a new version of the operating system, users' iPhones are re-indexing their files and apps so they can find them faster and more efficiently – in other words, this battery drain may just be temporary until your iPhone gets used to the new update. 

There are other things to look out for if battery loss continues – namely checking if it's lost capacity over time. Head to Settings > Battery > Battery Health to check whether your battery has deteriorated. 

If so, or if you want to extend battery life generally, there are plenty of Apple-recommended ways to do so, like turning off auto-brightness on your screen (Settings > General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations) and manually keeping it at a low setting.

You can also turn off apps refreshing in the background (Settings > General > Background App Refresh) and switch off location services within apps (Settings > Privacy > Location Services). Lastly, you can easily toggle off several of the above features just by switching to Low Power Mode (Settings > Battery).

Can't add or edit iOS 14 widgets
iOS 14 widgets are the star of this iPhone update, yet you may find it difficult to add or edit widgets. That's certainly an iOS 14 problem, if you ask us. 

New apps you download may not allow you to add widgets when tapping the + icon in the top right corner (while in jiggle mode). 

iOS 14 problem solved: While we're not going to consider this fully solved until Apple issues an update to fix the known widgets glitch, here's a quick fix we've found: if you open up the app and play around with it first, then close it, you may find that it appears within the widget list after hitting the + icon.

iOS 14 won't play YouTube in 4K or picture-in-picture - Solved
One of the big perks to the iOS 14 update is that you can now play videos in a small rectangular corner window even when you exit a video app. It's called picture-in-picture, and apps including FaceTime use it so you can video chat and browse another app, like your email or Safari, without the video pausing. 

iOS 14 problem solved: Picture-and-picture does work with YouTube, but the iOS 14 problem arises if you aren't logged into your YouTube Premium account (or don't subscribe to Google's paid ad-free service). The same applies for 4K videos on your iPhone – the iOS 14 feature won't work on this specific app unless you're a paid subscriber.

Delayed text when typing - Solved
This one's more annoying than disruptive, but it's still not ideal: users are reporting that at times, they'll type several words into a message or field before the text starts appearing. This has been a persistent issue since the iOS 14 beta versions, as users on Reddit and the MacRumors forums attest. 

It's an odd issue, to be sure, which TechRadar editors have only experienced sporadically; when we did, restarting our iPhone would temporarily solve the issue. 

iOS 14 problem solved: The change log for iOS 14.4 lists delayed typing as one of the included bug fixes, so hopefully an update to that should fix it.

Disconnecting from Wi-Fi – Solved
Plenty of users have complained on social media and forums about losing Wi-Fi after upgrading to iOS 14, as noticed by MacWorld. Some have pointed out that their connection drops when they lock their screen and put their iPhone into sleep mode, like this user on Apple forums, who claimed to need to manually reconnect to Wi-Fi.

iOS 14 problem solved: Apple rushed out an operating system update, iOS 14.0.1, that aims to fix issues preventing iPhones from connecting to Wi-Fi networks. Hopefully this particular problem is included in the fix.

iOS 14 problem solved: The first iOS 14 operating system update, iOS 14.0.1, included a fix explicitly for this issue, so hopefully it is resolved for users who have experienced it.

iPhone 7 camera viewfinder shows black screen – Solved
iPhone 7 owners like this official Apple forum poster are running into an issue with the camera app viewfinder turning completely dark. The user above reported that opening the viewfinder in Snapchat or Instagram resulted in a similar black screen. It’s unclear if it was only affecting iPhone 7 owners or if other iPhones have been affected.

iOS 14 problem solved: This issue was supposedly fixed in the rushed-out iOS 14.0.1 update, which specifically addressed the problem. 

'Jailbroken' warning
Gotten a message from an app that warned your iPhone was Jailbroken, like this user on the Apple forums? Don't fret – your app may not have fully updated to iOS 14 and is failing to recognize the new operating system as an official update. Give the developers some time and install the app's next update, if possible, or reach out to them to alert them of the issue if you're still getting the error message. "
article_4216,"Apple users updating their iPhones to iOS 14.2 are facing severe battery drain issues. The issues seem to have a noticeable impact on older iPhone models such as the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone X, iPhone 7, and the iPhone SE (2020). Alongside the iPhone models, some users updating their iPad to iPadOS 14.2 have also reported similar battery drain issues. Apple hasn't yet provided any clarity on whether the issues would be addressed through a new software update in the coming days.

As per the user complaints posted on the Apple Developer Forums, the battery drain issues on the iPhone models cropped up shortly after the release of iOS 14.2 in November. More users started noticing the problems with the passage of time, as brought into notice by a Reddit post. Some of the affected users have also taken to Twitter to highlight the battery issues after installing the iOS 14.2 update.

In most cases, the iPhone models running on iOS 14.2 are reportedly seeing battery life dropping quite significantly. People have seen the battery drop over 50 percent in less than 30 minutes, as highlighted in multiple user posts. Some users have also observed a sudden gain in the battery percentage after restarting their devices.

“My phone battery was perfectly fine before [the] update,” one of the affected users wrote on the Apple Developer Forums. “Now, it goes to one percent from 70 percent in [a] matter of minutes.”

The battery drain issues were mostly observed on older iPhone models, including the iPhone 11, iPhone XR? 38,999, iPhone 7? 24,999, and the iPhone SE (2020). Some iPad users on older models including the 2018 iPad Pro have also noticed sudden battery drops after updating to iPadOS 14.2 that arrived alongside iOS 14.2 in November.

It isn't clear whether there is any impact of the battery drain issues noticed after installing iOS 14.2 on the iPhone 12? 79,399 series. However, some iPhone 12 users also recently noticed drastic battery drops as well.

Gadgets 360 has reached out to Apple for clarity on a fix regarding the battery drain issues and will update this space when the company responds.

Meanwhile, if you haven't yet updated your iPhone to iOS 14.2, it would be worth waiting for the next update that may carry a fix for the reported battery drain issues.

This is not the first time when iPhone users have faced battery drain issues after installing a new iOS update. Just in the recent past, some users updating their iPhone models to iOS 14 reported battery life problems. Apple also acknowledged those complaints in October and suggested affected users erase all their content and settings from their iPhones to fix the issues."
article_4217,"Samsung is yet to release a fix for the issue.

Samsung Galaxy M31 — the budget smartphone by the South Korean giant — received a new software update with the April 2020 security patch earlier this week. While the latest software update was meant to provide various security fixes, it appears to have come with some bugs that are causing issues to users. Various affected users reported that their Galaxy M31 bricked while installing the latest update. Some Samsung Galaxy A70 users in the country, who received an Android 10 update along with One UI 2.0, also reported similar issues.

As per the user reports on on Twitter, several Samsung Galaxy M31 users ended up bricking their phones while attempting to install the latest update. The handset reportedly gets stuck during the installation process, according to the users.

Some of the affected users also reported similar problems on the Samsung Community forums. The affected users highlighted that since the phone gets bricked while installing the new software, they aren't able to even perform a factory restore to fix the problem.

Although some users claimed that they were able to resolve the issue after downloading a previous firmware from a third-party source, it isn't recommended as failing to flash the software could cause even serious problems.

Similar to the Galaxy M31, some Samsung Galaxy A70? 22,999 users in India have also reported similar bricking issues after installing the Android 10 update that comes with One UI 2.0. The problem on the Galaxy A70 was caused by a hardware mismatch, reports SamMobile. However, it isn't likely to be the reason in case of the Galaxy M31.

Some reports also suggest that Samsung has halted the update rollout for both the Galaxy M31 and Galaxy A70 to avoid further issues.

While Samsung may fix the issue in a future software update, the users whose phones are bricked have no respite until they can reach a company service centre, all of which are closed due to the nationwide lockdown. The company's social media hasn't been much help to the users either. Samsung does have the option to remotely assist its customers, but it is unclear whether the company plans to do that.

Gadgets 360 has reached out to Samsung India for a comment on the matter and will update this space when the company responds. Meanwhile, it is advisable to not install the latest update to avoid facing any issues.

Samsung Galaxy M31 is one of the company's latest phones in the country as it was launched in February this year.

article_4218,"Samsung Galaxy S20 smartphones that were launched in February seem to have landed in trouble. Several users on social media have recently pointed out that their Samsung Galaxy S20 smartphones are facing GPS-related issues especially while using Google Maps. Samsung has not officially addressed the problem however, some have claimed that the retail showrooms are replacing the units after they reported the issue. The problem also seems to be present in the Galaxy S20 units which used the Snapdragon-powered SoC instead of Samsung's own Exynos SoC. Previously some users also pointed out an issue with the camera of the new smartphones.

Samsung Galaxy S20? 70,490-series users living in America and Canada have pointed out on social media that while using apps such as Google Maps and Waze, the GPS in the phone was unable to freeze the detected location. A user on Twitter pointed out that despite restarting the phone, the apparent bug did not get fixed. Similarly, other users on Samsung Forums raised the same issues while using Google Maps. A user further claimed that despite turning off and then turning on the GPS, the problem still lingered. ""When using Google Maps or Waze I am getting a searching for GPS message on the screen. I have tried turning location off and back on and rebooting the phone. Not sure what else I can do to fix this issue,"" the user said.

After more users addressed the alleged problem on the forum, some further claimed that their Samsung Galaxy S20 units were replaced. At the moment it is unclear whether this is a software bug that is causing the problem or a hardware issue with the handset.

Since most of the users who reported the issue are living countries like the US and Canada, we are assuming the alleged bug is present in the Snapdragon-powered units. To recall, Samsung released the Galaxy S20 lineup, which includes the Galaxy S20, the Galaxy S20+ and Galaxy S20 Ultra? 77,777 with either Samsung Exynos 990 SoC or Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC. The Samsung Galaxy S20 phones that are sold in India use an Exynos-powered processor, unlike the US units which use the Snapdragon processors. This is possibly why we have not come across users complaining about GPS-related issues in the country.

Earlier this week, Samsung also tried fixing an auto-focus camera issue that was pointed out by several users. However, it is not fully resolved yet and an update from Samsung is expected in the coming weeks."
article_4219,"Samsung’s just launched Galaxy S20 FE is reportedly giving some grief to users who have bought it. Some of these users are reporting touchscreen issues with the Galaxy S20 FE, and they have taken to Reddit to share their experience. Some have also reported the issues on XDA-Developers Samsung user forums"
article_4220,"Motorola released an update to fix one of the reported issues, though not all users have apparently been addressed so far.

Motorola Edge+ has a couple of display issues, as per user reports. While one issue brings smudges to the display, the other one seems to discolour the display and adds a green colour effect. Several users have reported the issue on the Lenovo Forums alongside sharing some images to highlight the problems they're facing with the Motorola Edge+. Lenovo-owned Motorola also seeded an update last week specifically to fix the smudging issue. However, some users have pointed out that despite the new update, they're still facing the problem.

“My very new Edge Plus has just started having these purple spots creep onto the screen if it's on for a long period of time,” one of the early affected users reported on the Lenovo Forums late last month. Shortly after the first report emerged online, several users echoed the same smudging problem that brings blacked out spots and green tint on the display panel of the Motorola Edge+.

A forum admin quickly responded to the initial set of affected users and promised a software update that would fix the issue. The update reached Verizon customers at the end of last week with a build number QPB30.188-48, reports Droid Life. It included a changelog that specified “improved display contrast and clarity” alongside the June Android security patch.

Some users on the Lenovo Forums mentioned that after receiving the latest software update, they weren't able to notice any smudges on the display. However, this isn't the case with all the users who're facing display issues on the Motorola Edge+. A few users said that even after installing the update, they're able to notice some problems with the panel that has dual edges and is one of the unique selling points (USPs) of the new Motorola flagship.

The forum admin responded to user complaints by saying that the smudging issue could be corrected through the new software, though there aren't any details around the problem that discolours the screen and brings a green shade on top.

“If yours did not clear up, we now recommend exchanging it,” the admin said. “Apparently some displays could be beyond the point of recovery via software.”

It is unclear whether the issues are limited to the US variant of the Motorola Edge+ or also available on its global units. Gadgets 360 reached out to Motorola for clarity and received a statement from the company.

""We are aware of these isolated Edge+ reports and delivered a solution to affected consumers via a software update. Additionally, we are investigating reports that some active units are still experiencing the issue and ask that these Edge+ owners receive individual actions from the Motorola Support Team,"" the company said in the statement.

"
article_4221,"The company has rolled out software update to fix it but if that doesn't work people will have get the phones replaced.

Motorola Edge+ has got some interesting feedback from consumers since its launch. But the company has got a major scare this week after some users complained about screen issues with the device. People has posted the issue on Motorola forums with images of their phones. Apparently, they are seeing purple patches on the both the sides of the display. Also Read - Motorola One Fusion+ launched in India at Rs 16,999; first Flipkart sale on June 24

This makes a huge difference to the colour quality of the screen. The users mentioned that after keeping the phone for a while, they patch disappears but comes back again. The problem seems to have picked up from few users since last month. But now it has spread to a larger number, causing concerns for the company. Also Read - The dual-screen Microsoft Surface Duo smartphone could be announced in late July

Thankfully, the Motorola Forum admin has reached out to all these users. He’s also confirmed that a software update will be rolled out to fix the display issue. Motorola Edge+ users on Verizon have reportedly got a new firmware with display changes mentioned in the log. The update seems to have fixed the issue for few units but not everyone. Also Read - Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 display specs revealed

Noticing this, the admin connected with users once again, suggesting the issue might not be fixable with a software update. Instead, the people who’re still facing issues might have to get their device replaced. Motorola launched the Edge+ in India few weeks back, and we’re hoping the company helps the affected users with a better solution in the country.

The Motorola Edge+ also features a 6.67-inch full-HD+ curved OLED display with 90Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ support and a punch-hole selfie camera design. Internally, it is different from Edge sibling. Motorola has used Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 865 SoC paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of non-expandable UFS 3.0 storage."
article_4222,"Some Xiaomi and Redmi devices are facing a peculiar issue with many users recently complaining of facing a strange issue that has forced their phones to go on a continuous rebooting loop. This issue has earned the company a lot of heat on social media, with the company still to issue a fix.

And now Airtel, the telecom operators whose users also appear to be facing problems because of this issue, has come out and confirmed the issue. Taking to Twitter, Harmeen Mehta, the company's Global CIO, has said that the company is working with Mi India to fix crashing and other issues that some Airtel India users are experiencing with the Xiaomi phones.

She further confirmed that while a fix is awaited and will come from Xiaomi end, the telecom operator has put out a small tweak in the Airtel Thanks app to help users. She added in a second tweet that the issue is from Xiaomi's end, and will be fixed once the company releases a new update for Airtel users ""tomorrow"".

While the Airtel executive did not explain the issue being faced by users, several Airtel users have taken to the web to report that their devices are stuck in a boot loop after encountering a “Find Device Closed Unexpectedly” error. This issue has left their devices unusable, and as such is proving to be a great source of discomfort to them.

As of now, it's only Airtel that's come out and publicly highlighted the issue, with other telecom operators not saying anything on the matter. Earlier, Mi India had also released a statement acknowledging the issue, where it confirmed that it had observed certain Mi and Redmi devices encountering the issue of continuous rebooting. Taking customer feedback into consideration, the company confirmed that its team is working towards fixing the problem at the earliest.

In a statement it said, ""It has come to our notice that Mi & Redmi devices are showing an error, causing unwanted rebooting of the device. It has been observed that certain lines of code are misbehaving during an app update. While we are working on fixing the issue with the App developer and rolling out a permanent update by early next week, we have put temporary containment measures in place, over the last 36 hours. This fix may need consumers to get their devices flashed at a service centre. At Mi India, customer experience is the topmost priority and we regret the inconvenience caused to them. As a committed brand, our endeavour is to continue delivering on our consumer expectations, thereby offering best user experience to everyone.”"
article_4223,"Mi, Redmi, and Poco users are facing an issue that puts their phones into a bootloop, making them restart again and again. The problem, which appears to have impacted a large number of users, emerges after the phones receive an error that reads, “Find Device closed unexpectedly.” Although Xiaomi is investigating the issue, the company has noted in a statement that it emerged due to certain lines of code misbehaving during an app update. A fix has also been promised that the company said will reach affected users shortly.

As per the user reports on social media, the phones running a MIUI 12.05 Global Stable ROM seem to have chiefly impacted due to the issue. The affected users aren't able to make any changes from their end as the phones start rebooting in the loop. Some users also lost their data as they eventually had to reset their phones.




 

The issue isn't limited to a certain smartphone model and has been reported by a list of Mi, Redmi, and Poco devices, including the Mi 10T Pro, Mi 10, Redmi K20 Pro, Redmi Note 9, Redmi Note 7 Pro, and Poco X3, among others. Also, it isn't likely to be limited to India as a user from Nigeria has also reported an identical problem on Twitter.

Xiaomi acknowledged the issue in the statement to Gadgets 360 and said that it was due to an app update. The company also assured that an update would arrive by this week. Meanwhile, some “temporary containment measures” are already in place, according to Xiaomi.

“This fix may need consumers to get their devices flashed at a service centre,” the company said. It is, however, unclear whether the fix would cause any data loss to the affected users.

Xiaomi didn't provide any clarity on which app is causing the issue to users. However, some users speculate that it came due to the Airtel Thanks app.

Airtel Global CIO Harmeen Mehta in a tweet posted on Saturday underlined that the telco had worked with Xiaomi to find the cause and was preparing a fix. She also stated that a small tweak had already been provided in the Airtel Thanks app to temporarily resolve the problem.

Having said that, there is no clarity on how the affected users would be able to fix the bootloop issue on their devices. Airtel, on its part, also didn't provide any details on whether it would provide a resolution through a server-side update to the Airtel Thanks app as the issue isn't apparently allowing the users to access the app or install any of its updates from Google Play."
article_4224,"If you inquire for a good phone, almost all time shopkeeper will suggest you Oppo/Vivo. The retailer at the shop gets a higher margin in selling Vivo/Oppo mobile than other brands, and that is why they promote and sells these mobiles.

If a person buys oppo or vivo phone, the 10–15% that you pay goes as a commission to the shopkeepers. It means you are paying that 10–15% extra from your pocket.

Oppo and Vivo smartphones are not bad at all. But they are not valued for money at all. I think the problem with Oppo and Vivo phones is the price to performance ratio that they have got. These two companies are from the same parent company. Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus are owned by the same company BBK Electronics from China.

Let’s look at some examples.

 

OVERPRICED
Oppo launched a smartphone Oppo F9 Pro with waterdrop notch and Helio P60 processor at 23,990 rupees. Recently Realme ( Realme was a sub-brand of Oppo, But now it is an independent company ) launched Realme 2 Pro with similar waterdrop notch and with Snapdragon 660 processor at just starting price of 13,990. If we compare both these smartphones, then the processor on the Realme is better than Oppo, and the cameras are also better on Realme. There are 8000 rupees price difference between the 6 GB ram variant of both these smartphones.

Why should you pay 8000 more rupees when you are getting better specification at a lower price. Just because Oppo is spending a lot of money for the advertisement. If an Ex-Sub Brand of Oppo can offer the same spec at 8000 rupees lower, then it is clear that the extra money we are spending on the Oppo devices is just because of the advertising and marketing.

Now let’s talk about Vivo. Vivo V11 Pro, a new smartphone from the brand at the price of 25,990 rupees. With the Same Snapdragon 660 processor. Realme is offering this processor at 13,990 rupees. Xiaomi is offering this processor in one of the best smartphone Mi A2 at 16,999 rupees. Then why should you pay extra money for that? No doubt that Vivo V11 Pro comes with In-display fingerprint sensor, which is a new technology to unlock the smartphone. So if you want to unlock your smartphone in a futuristic way then pay extra money. Otherwise, Poco F1 with Snapdragon 845 flagship SOC is available at just 21,000 rupees. 4,000 less than what Vivo is pricing for the Snapdragon 660.

BUILD QUALITY
Oppo/Vivo smartphones are always in eye-catching glossy colours which looks good, but it’s plastic after all. It does not feel premium in hand.

Two years ago I purchased Redmi 3s Prime at rupees 8,999 rupees. One of my friends bought Oppo F1 plus smartphone somewhere near 20,000 rupees. I’m still using the device without any problem, and I’m getting the latest security updates while the fingerprint sensor of Oppo F1 plus had stopped working in just a year. Xiaomi offered better specification at half of the price.

 

OPERATING SYSTEM
ColorOS (with only colours) and FuntouchOS (no fun to touch) is their heavily skinned OS based on Android. They both look identical to each other, but they’re unprofessional mixing of Android and iOS. Both companies are known for poor software maintenance and updates, expect no significant Android upgrade because they don’t make one, once it’s Nougat, it always is Nougat. Still, they only roll out bug fixes and performance improvements to their phones; they only inject new software to their latest models.

 

NOT VALUE FOR MONEY DEVICES
One of my friends purchased Oppo F5 Youth at 15k rupees. From cameras to the processor, nothing seems good on that device. I’ve compared it side by side with Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro ( Price 15k ), and the difference was huge. Oppo is known as Selfie Expert, but the only megapixel is big in numbers on their smartphones, the picture quality is not good. I mean the picture looks good just because of higher brightness and saturation level, but there is a lack of details and sharpness.

These brand should stop wasting money on brand ambassadors; instead, they should give better specification at honest pricing. Every single brand, including Samsung ( Excluding Apple ! ), are making better devices, and they are continuously decreasing the price.

If one brand offers you a better device at a lower price, then why should you buy an Oppo or Vivo smartphone?

Oppo and Vivo are continuously trying to decrease the price and give a better product to us. But still, they need more improvements. One thing I like about these smartphones is the after-sale service. If you find any issue with these smartphones, you can go to the nearest mobile shop, and the problem will be fixed very soon.

Before visiting the nearest mobile shop, have a look at Flipkart and Amazon, maybe you’ll get more value for your money."
